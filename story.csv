"I spotted it in a junk shop in Bridport, a roll-top desk. The man said it was early nineteenth century, and oak. I had wanted one, but they were far too expensive. This one was in a bad condition, the roll-top in several pieces, one leg clumsily mended, scorch marks all down one side. It was going for very little money. I thought I could restore it. It would be a risk, a challenge, but I had to have it. I paid the man and brought it back to my workroom at the back of the garage. I began work on it on Christmas Eve. I removed the roll-top completely and pulled out the drawers. The veneer had lifted almost everywhere ? it looked like water damage to me. Both fire and water had clearly taken their toll on this desk. The last drawer was stuck fast. I tried all I could to ease it out gently. In the end I used brute force. I struck it sharply with the side of my fist and the drawer flew open to reveal a shallow space underneath, a secret drawer. There was something in there. I reached in and took out a small black tin box. Sello-taped to the top of it was a piece of lined notepaper, and written on it in shaky handwriting: ?Jim?s last letter, received January 25, 1915. To be buried with me when the time comes.? I knew as I did it that it was wrong of me to open the box, but curiosity got the better of my scruples. It usually does. Inside the box there was an envelope. The address read: ?Mrs Jim Macpherson, 12 Copper Beeches, Bridport, Dorset.? I took out the letter and unfolded it. It was written in pencil and dated at the top ? ?December 26, 1914?.","Once upon a time, in a dusty junk shop in Bridport, I found a battered roll-top desk that looked like it had seen better days. The owner claimed it was early nineteenth century and made of sturdy oak. Despite its scorch marks and one mended leg, it was a bargain! So, I bought it on a whim, planning to restore it in my garage.
On Christmas Eve, I dove into the task, hoping to salvage some wood magic. As I pried open the last drawer, I accidentally unleashed a secret compartment that hid a small black tin box. It was taped up with a note saying, ?Jim?s last letter, received January 25, 1915. To be buried with me when the time comes.?
Feeling like an undercover agent, I opened it anyway. Inside, an envelope awaited me, addressed to ?Mrs. Jim Macpherson, 12 Copper Beeches.? The letter, written in pencil, dated December 26, 1914, made me chuckle as it detailed Jim?s complaints about his terrible Christmas pudding!
Turns out, Jim wanted to escape the horrors of war but ended up stuck with his in-laws instead. I burst out laughing, realizing that Jim's last letter wasn?t about heroics but about family feuds over dessert.

"Dearest Connie, I write to you in a much happier frame of mind because something wonderful has just happened that I must tell you about at once. We were all standing to in our trenches yesterday morning, Christmas morning. It was crisp and quiet all about, as beautiful a morning as I?ve ever seen, as cold and frosty as a Christmas morning should be. I should like to be able to tell you that we began it. But the truth, I?m ashamed to say, is that Fritz began it. First someone saw a white flag waving from the trenches opposite. Then they were calling out to us from across no man?s land, ?Happy Christmas, Tommy! Happy Christmas!? When we had got over the surprise, some of us shouted back, ?Same to you, Fritz! Same to you!? I thought that would be that. We all did. But then suddenly one of them was up there in his grey greatcoat and waving a white flag. ?Don?t shoot, lads!? someone shouted. And no one did. Then there was another Fritz up on the parapet, and another. ?Keep your heads down,? I told the men, ?it?s a trick.? But it wasn?t. One of the Germans was waving a bottle above his head. ?It is Christmas Day, Tommy. We have schnapps. We have sausage. We meet you? Yes?? By this time there were dozens of them walking towards us across no man?s land and not a rifle between them. Little Private Morris was the first up. ?Come on, boys. What are we waiting for?? And then there was no stopping them. I was the officer. I should have stopped them there and then, I suppose, but the truth is that it never even occurred to me I should. All along their line and ours I could see men walking slowly towards one another, grey coats, khaki coats meeting in the middle. And I was one of them. I was part of this. In the middle of the war we were making peace. You cannot imagine, dearest Connie, my feelings as I looked into the eyes of the Fritz officer, who approached me, hand outstretched. ?Hans Wolf,? he said, gripping my hand warmly and holding it. ?I am from Dusseldorf. I play the cello in the orchestra. Happy Christmas.? ?Captain Jim Macpherson,? I replied. ?And a Happy Christmas to you too. I?m a school teacher from Dorset, in the west of England.? ?Ah, Dorset,? he smiled. ?I know this place. I know it very well.? We shared my rum ration and his excellent sausage. And we talked, Connie, how we talked. He spoke almost perfect English. But it turned out that he had never set foot in Dorset, never even been to England. He had learned all he knew of England from school, and from reading books in English. His favourite writer was Thomas Hardy, his favourite book Far from the Madding Crowd. So out there in no man?s land we talked of Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy and Dorset. He had a wife and one son, born just six months ago. As I looked about me there were huddles of khaki and grey everywhere, all over no man?s land, smoking, laughing, talking, drinking, eating. Hans Wolf and I shared what was left of your wonderful Christmas cake, Connie. He thought the marzipan was the best he had ever tasted. I agreed. We agreed about everything, and he was my enemy. There never was a Christmas party like it, Connie. Then someone, I don?t know who, brought out a football. Greatcoats were dumped in piles to make goalposts, and the next thing we knew it was Tommy against Fritz out in the middle of no man?s land. Hans Wolf and I looked on and cheered, clapping our hands and stamping our feet, to keep out the cold as much as anything. There was a moment when I noticed our breaths mingling in the air between us. He saw it too and smiled. ?Jim Macpherson,? he said after a while, ?I think this is how we should resolve this war. A football match. No one dies in a football match. No children are orphaned. No wives become widows.? ?I?d prefer cricket,? I told him. ?Then we Tommies could be sure of winning, probably.? We laughed at that, and together we watched the game. Sad to say, Connie, Fritz won, two goals to one. But as Hans Wolf generously said, our goal was wider than theirs, so it wasn?t quite fair. The time came, and all too soon, when the game was finished, the schnapps and the rum and the sausage had long since run out, and we knew it was all over. I wished Hans well and told him I hoped he would see his family again soon, that the fighting would end and we could all go home. ?I think that is what every soldier wants, on both sides,? Hans Wolf said. ?Take care, Jim Macpherson. I shall never forget this moment, nor you.? He saluted and walked away from me slowly, unwillingly, I felt. He turned to wave just once and then became one of the hundreds of grey-coated men drifting back towards their trenches. That night, back in our dugouts, we heard them singing a carol, and singing it quite beautifully. It was Stille Nacht, Silent Night. Our boys gave them a rousing chorus of While Shepherds Watched. We exchanged carols for a while and then we all fell silent. We had had our time of peace and goodwill, a time I will treasure as long as I live. Dearest Connie, by Christmas time next year, this war will be nothing but a distant and terrible memory. I know from all that happened today how much both armies long for peace. We shall be together again soon, I?m sure of it. ","Let me share a wonderful tale from Christmas morning that sounds like a scene from a whimsical play! We were in our trenches, surrounded by frosty air, when out popped a white flag from the other side!
Fritz called out, ?Happy Christmas, Tommy!? and soon we were all shouting back like a bunch of confused penguins! Then, a brave soul from the German side waved a bottle and shouted, ?We have schnapps and sausage!? This sounded like the best party invitation ever!
Little Private Morris yelled, ?What are we waiting for?? and off we went, meeting in the middle of no man?s land. I met Hans Wolf, a cellist who had never even visited Dorset but adored Thomas Hardy like a true literary nerd!
Next, someone produced a football! We tossed aside our gear and played a match: Tommy vs. Fritz! I joked, ?If it were cricket, we?d definitely win!? Alas, Fritz won, but Hans said it was because our goal was wider, so it was still a fair game.
Afterward, we exchanged Christmas cake, and I realized he thought your marzipan was divine! That night, we sang Silent Night, harmonizing like a mixed-up choir, and I knew that by next year, this war would be just a distant memory.
So, here?s to a world where football matches and cake replace bullets and bombs! I?m certain we?ll meet again, perhaps at a Christmas tea party with even more laughter!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"I folded the letter again and slipped it carefully back into its envelope. I kept awake all night. By morning I knew what I had to do. I drove into Bridport, just a few miles away. I asked a boy walking his dog where Copper Beeches was. House number 12 turned out to be nothing but a burned-out shell, the roof gaping, the windows boarded-up. I knocked at the house next door and asked if anyone knew the whereabouts of a Mrs Macpherson. Oh yes, said the old man in his slippers, he knew her well. A lovely old lady, he told me, a bit muddle-headed, but at her age she was entitled to be, wasn?t she? A hundred and one years old. She had been in the house when it caught fire. No one really knew how the fire had started, but it could well have been candles. She used candles rather than electricity, because she always thought electricity was too expensive. The fireman had got her out just in time. She was in a nursing home now, he told me, Burlington House, on the Dorchester road, on the other side of town. I found Burlington House Nursing Home easily enough. There were paper chains up in the hallway and a lighted Christmas tree stood in the corner with a lopsided angel on top. I said I was a friend come to visit Mrs Macpherson to bring her a Christmas present. I could see through into the dining room where everyone was wearing a paper hat and singing. The matron had a hat on too and seemed happy enough to see me. She even offered me a mince pie. She walked me along the corridor. ?Mrs Macpherson is not in with the others,? she told me. ?She?s rather confused today so we thought it best if she had a good rest. She has no family you know, no one visits. So I?m sure she?ll be only too pleased to see you.? She took me into a conservatory with wicker chairs and potted plants all around and left me. The old lady was sitting in a wheelchair, her hands folded in her lap. She had silver white hair pinned into a wispy bun. She was gazing out at the garden. ?Hello,? I said. She turned and looked up at me vacantly. ?Happy Christmas, Connie,? I went on. ?I found this. I think it?s yours.? As I was speaking her eyes never left my face. I opened the tin box and gave it to her. That was the moment her eyes lit up with recognition and her face became suffused with a sudden glow of happiness. I explained about the desk, about how I had found it, but I don't think she was listening. For a while she said nothing, but stroked the letter tenderly with her fingertips. Suddenly she reached out and took my hand. Her eyes were filled with tears. ?You told me you?d come home by Christmas, dearest,? she said. ?And here you are, the best Christmas present in the world. Come closer, Jim dear, sit down.? I sat down beside her, and she kissed my cheek. ?I read your letter so often Jim, every day. I wanted to hear your voice in my head. It always made me feel you were with me. And now you are. Now you?re back you can read it to me yourself. Would you do that for me, Jim dear? I just want to hear your voice again. I?d love that so much. And then perhaps we?ll have some tea. I?ve made you a nice Christmas cake, marzipan all around. I know how much you love marzipan."," Jim?s Christmas Cake Adventure
I folded the letter and slipped it into my pocket, feeling like a secret agent on a mission. After a sleepless night, I decided to visit Bridport to find Mrs. Macpherson.
Upon arrival, I learned that Copper Beeches was a burned-out shell, like something from a horror movie! I knocked on the neighbor?s door, and the old man in slippers told me about Mrs. Macpherson, a muddle-headed lady, now 101 years old!
He explained she had escaped a fire, likely caused by her love for candles instead of expensive electricity. I headed to Burlington House, the nursing home, excited to find her.
Inside, there were paper chains and a Christmas tree topped with a lopsided angel. The matron, wearing her festive hat, greeted me and offered me a mince pie. ?Mrs. Macpherson is resting,? she said. ?She?s rather confused.?
I was led to the conservatory, where I found her gazing at the garden like she was watching grass grow. ?Happy Christmas, Connie!? I said, handing her the tin box containing the letter. Her eyes sparkled with recognition.
Tears filled her eyes as she grasped my hand. ?You told me you?d come home by Christmas, dearest!? she exclaimed, and I felt like the best gift ever. She asked me to read the letter aloud, saying, ?I?ve missed your voice!?
After reading, she smiled and said, ?I?ve made you a Christmas cake with marzipan! I know how much you love it!? We shared a laugh over the cake, and I realized this was the most delicious Christmas reunion I could have ever imagined!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"You know that the paper is a model for a plane surface. When you join a number of points without lifting a pencil from the paper (and without retracing any portion of the drawing other than single points), you get a plane curve.. A simple closed curve made up of only line segments is called a polygon. Can you find how these types of polygons differ from one another? Polygons that are convex have no portions of their diagonals in their exteriors or any line segment joining any two different points, in the interior of the polygon, lies wholly in the interior of it . Is this true with concave polygons? Study the figures given. Then try to describe in your own words what we mean by a convex polygon and what we mean by a concave polygon. Give two rough sketches of each kind. A regular polygon is both ?equiangular? and ?equilateral?. For example, a square has sides of equal length and angles of equal measure. Hence it is a regular polygon. A rectangle is In our work in this class, we will be dealing with convex polygons only. On many occasions a knowledge of exterior angles may throw light on the nature of interior angles and sides. Based on the nature of the sides or angles of a quadrilateral, it gets special names. Trapezium is a quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides. Kite is a special type of a quadrilateral. The sides with the same markings in each figure are equal. For example AB = AD and BC = CD. Study these figures and try to describe what a kite is. Observe that (i) A kite has 4 sides (It is a quadrilateral). (ii) There are exactly two distinct consecutive pairs of sides of equal length. Check whether a square is a kite. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral. As the name suggests, it has something to do with parallel lines. There are four sides and four angles in a parallelogram. Some of these are equal. There are some terms associated with these elements that you need to remember. Given a parallelogram ABCD (Fig 3.12). AB and DC, are opposite sides. AD and BC form another pair of opposite sides. ?A and ?C are a pair of opposite angles; another pair of opposite angles would be ?B and ?D. AB and BC are adjacent sides. This means, one of the sides starts where the other ends. Are BC and CD adjacent sides too? Try to find two more pairs of adjacent sides. ?A and ?B are adjacent angles. They are at the ends of the same side. ?B and ?C are also adjacent. Identify other pairs of adjacent angles of the parallelogram. Make a linking method of memory","Once upon a time in the land of Polygons, there were two kinds: Convex and Concave. Convex polygons were like happy families?everyone was included, and no one was left outside! They had no diagonal secrets lurking outside, and any line drawn between two points stayed inside.
In contrast, the Concave polygons were a bit shy; they had some secret angles that made them feel left out, like a parenthesis in a book! If you drew a line between some points, it could sneak outside the polygon, making it a little complicated.
To understand these characters, let?s make some sketches. The Convex Polygon looked like a happy house with all straight edges, while the Concave Polygon resembled a curvy snake, with some parts poking inwards!
Now, among these polygons, we had the Regular Polygon, which was a superstar! The square was a shining example, with equal sides and angles?like a perfectly frosted cake! But a rectangle, though it had equal angles, wasn?t quite regular because its sides were not equal.
Next up was the Kite?not the flying kind, but a special quadrilateral with two pairs of equal sides. Picture it as two lovers holding hands! So yes, a square is indeed a kite, as it holds the same hand with all equal lengths!
Then came the Parallelogram, known for its parallel sides. It was like a bridge where two sides always walked together, keeping things balanced. Angles danced with each other, forming pairs like best friends, with adjacent sides hanging out together.
In this world of polygons, every shape had its personality and role. And so, we learned to appreciate the differences while laughing at their quirky traits!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
":- Recall the activity of burning of magnesium ribbon performed in Class VII. We learnt that magnesium burns to form magnesium oxide and produces heat and light (Fig. 4.1). We can perform a similar activity with a piece of charcoal. Hold the piece with a pair of tongs and bring it near the flame of a candle or a Bunsen burner. What do you observe? We find that charcoal burns in air. We know that coal, too, burns in air producing carbon dioxide, heat and light. A chemical process in which a substance reacts with oxygen to give off heat is called combustion. The substance that undergoes combustion is said to be combustible. It is also called a fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or gas. Sometimes, light is also given off during combustion, either as a flame or as a glow. In the reactions mentioned above magnesium and charcoal are combustible substances. Can you name some more substances which are combustible? You can add those to Table 4.1. Let us investigate conditions under which combustion takes place. We find that for combustion, air is necessary. The candle burns freely in case (a) when air can enter the chimney from below. In case (b), when air does not enter the chimney from below, the flame flickers and produces smoke. In case (c), the flame finally goes off because the air is not available. You might have heard that when the clothes of a person catch fire, the person is covered with a blanket to extinguish fire (Fig. 4.3). Can you guess why? Now recall some of your experiences. Does a matchstick burn by itself? How does it burn? You must have had an experience of burning a piece of paper. Does it burn when a burning matchstick is brought near it? Can you burn a piece of wood by bringing a lighted matchstick near it? Why do you have to use paper or kerosene oil to start fire in wood or coal? Have you heard of forest fires? different substances catch fire at different temperatures? The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition temperature. Can you tell now why a matchstick does not catch fire on its own at room temperature? Why does the matchstick start burning on rubbing it on the side of the matchbox? We find that a combustible substance cannot catch fire or burn as long as its temperature is lower than its ignition temperature. Have you ever seen cooking oil catching fire when a frying pan is kept for long on a burning stove? Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire on their own at room temperature. But, if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will catch fire. But if wood is heated a little, it would still not catch fire. Does it mean that ignition temperature of kerosene oil is lower than that of wood? Does it mean that we need to take special care in storing kerosene oil? The following activity shows that it is essential for a substance to reach ignition temperature to burn. What happens to the empty paper cup? What happens to the paper cup with water? Does water in this cup become hot? If we continue heating the cup, we can even boil water in the paper cup. Can you think of an explanation for this phenomenon? The heat supplied to the paper cup is transferred to water by conduction. So, in the presence of water, the ignition temperature of paper is not reached. Hence, it does not burn. The substances which have very low ignition temperature and can easily catch fire with a flame are called inflammable substances. Examples of inflammable substances are petrol, alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) etc. Can you list some more inflammable substances?:- Recall the activity of burning of magnesium ribbon performed in Class VII.

One day in Chemistry Land, a curious student named Sam remembered the thrilling experiment from Class VII where magnesium ribbon was burned, transforming into magnesium oxide while glowing and releasing heat. Inspired, Sam decided to experiment with charcoal next!
With a pair of tongs, Sam held a piece of charcoal near a candle flame. ""Look! It's burning and producing carbon dioxide, heat, and light!"" Sam exclaimed. They learned that this magical process is called combustion?a dance with oxygen that makes things burn. ?Charcoal, magnesium?what else can burn?? Sam wondered, jotting down wood, paper, and kerosene in their notebook.
Eager to explore further, Sam set up a candle in three different ways: with air flowing freely, with restricted airflow, and without air. ""Wow! The flame flickers and goes out without air!"" Sam shouted. ?No air, no fire! Just like when you cover a fire with a blanket to put it out.?
Next, Sam grabbed a matchstick. ?Why doesn?t it burn on its own at room temperature?? they mused. Sam remembered how it ignited when rubbed against the matchbox?reaching its ignition temperature. ?So, combustible substances won?t burn unless they get hot enough!?
With curiosity, Sam thought about cooking oil. ?What happens if I leave a frying pan on too long?? They recalled the time the oil caught fire, realizing that kerosene has a lower ignition temperature than wood. ?I need to be careful with that!?
Then Sam conducted a little experiment with a paper cup. ""If I heat it, what will happen?"" they pondered. When they added water to the cup and heated it, the paper didn?t burn! ?Aha! The water absorbs the heat, keeping the ignition temperature low!? Sam exclaimed, eyes wide with discovery.
Finally, Sam learned about inflammable substances?those sneaky things that ignite easily, like petrol and alcohol. ?I better write down more examples, like lighter fluid and gasoline!? they giggled, imagining a tiny fire sprite dancing around.
With a big smile, Sam closed their notebook, excited for more adventures in the fascinating world of combustion!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"On April 1, 2017 they admitted John as a new partner with 1/6 share in profits of the firm. With this change now there are three partners of the firm and it stands reconstituted. Change in the profit sharing ratio among the existing partners: Sometimes the partners of a firm may decide to change their existing profit sharing ratio. This may happen an account of a change in the existing partners? role in the firm. For example, Ram, Mohan and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1. With effect from April 1,2017 they decided to share profits equally as Sohan brings in additional capital. This results in a change in the existing agreement leading to reconstitution of the firm. Retirement of an existing partner: It means withdrawal by a partner from the business of the firm which may be due to his bad health, old age or change in business interests. In fact a partner can retire any time if the partnership is at will. For example, Roy, Ravi and Rao are partners in the firm sharing profits in the ratio of 2:2:1. On account of illness, Ravi retired from the firm on March 31, 2017. This results in reconstitution of the firm now having only two partners. Death of a partner: Partnership may also stand reconstituted on death of a partner, if the remaining partners decide to continue the business of the firm as usual. For example, X,Y and Z are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio 3:2:1. X died on March 31, 2017. Y and Z decide to carry on the business sharing future profits equally. The continuity of business by Y and Z sharing future profits equally leads to reconstitution of the firm.","Once upon a time in Partnership Land, three partners?Hari, Haqque, and John?decided to shake things up. One sunny day, Hari and Haqque were sitting in their cozy cafe, sharing profits in a 3:2 ratio, when they thought, ?Hey, we need help!? So, they welcomed John into the team, giving him 1/6 share of their profits. With this change, their firm got a fancy new name: ""The Triumphant Trio!""
But that wasn't the end of the fun! One day, Ram, Mohan, and Sohan, partners who shared profits like 3:2:1, sat down to chat. ?Sohan has been working harder and wants to bring in some extra cash,? Ram said. ?Let?s share profits equally!? they decided, transforming their ratio into a 1:1:1. Suddenly, they became the ""Equal Opportunity Partners!""
In another corner of Partnership Land, Roy, Ravi, and Rao were running a popular pet grooming business. But alas! Poor Ravi fell ill. ?I can?t groom another dog!? he exclaimed dramatically. ?I must retire!? On March 31, 2017, he waved goodbye, leaving Roy and Rao to continue as the ""Dynamic Duo!""
Meanwhile, tragedy struck in the firm of X, Y, and Z. Their profit-sharing ratio was a perfect 3:2:1 until X met his unfortunate end (he tripped over a giant rubber chicken!). ?We must carry on!? declared Y and Z, deciding to share future profits equally. They became the ""Partners in Peril!""
With each twist and turn, the partnerships continued to reconstitute, proving that business is always an adventure filled with surprises. And in the end, all the partners learned that change is just another way to grow and have a little fun!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Consider any general static charge configuration. We define potential energy of a test charge q in terms of the work done on the charge q. This work is obviously proportional to q, since the force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field at that point due to the given charge configuration. It is, therefore, convenient to divide the work by the amount of charge q, so that the resulting quantity is independent of q. In other words, work done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electric field associated with the charge configuration. This leads to the idea of electrostatic potential V due to a given charge configuration. From Eq. (2.1), we get: Work done by external force in bringing a unit positive charge from point R to P = VP ? VR = ? ? ? ? ? ? ? U U q P R (2.4) where VP and VR are the electrostatic potentials at P and R, respectively. Note, as before, that it is not the actual value of potential but the potential difference that is physically significant. If, as before, we choose the potential to be zero at infinity, Eq. (2.4) implies: Work done by an external force in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to a point = electrostatic potential (V ) at that point. In other words, the electrostatic potential (V ) at any point in a region with electrostatic field is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge (without acceleration) from infinity to that point. The qualifying remarks made earlier regarding potential energy also apply to the definition of potential. To obtain the work done per unit test charge, we should take an infinitesimal test charge dq, obtain the work done dW in bringing it from infinity to the point and determine the ratio dW/dq. Also, the external force at every point of the path is to be equal and opposite to the electrostatic force on the test charge at that point.","Once upon a time in Charge Land, a curious little charge named q wanted to explore the magical world of electric fields. ?I?ve heard there?s a place called Infinity where charges go to become powerful!? thought q excitedly. So, it set off on its adventure.
Along the way, q met a wise old charge named E, who was busy calculating the electric field at every point. ?To get to your destination, you must understand potential energy,? E explained, scratching its head. ?It?s all about the work done on you, little charge!?
As they traveled, E showed q how the work done to bring it to a point P from R could be written as: Work=VP?VR\text{Work} = V_P - V_RWork=VP?VR ?Where VPV_PVP is the potential at point P, and VRV_RVR is at point R!? shouted E, waving its tiny arms. ?It?s like magic! The work done per unit charge gives you the electric potential!?
Suddenly, a mischievous particle named U popped out and said, ?You know, the real fun happens when you choose the potential to be zero at infinity! That means the work done to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to point P is simply the electrostatic potential VVV at point P!?
?But wait,? q asked, ?how do you calculate all this?? E chuckled and replied, ?Simple! Take an infinitesimal test charge dqdqdq, do some work dWdWdW in bringing it from infinity, and then find the ratio dW/dqdW/dqdW/dq.?
Just then, a gust of wind blew, and a force appeared, reminding them that the external force must always be equal and opposite to the electrostatic force on the test charge. ?It?s all about balance!? the force shouted, flexing its muscles.
Finally, as they reached the magical point P, q realized the beauty of the potential difference and how it made the whole adventure meaningful. With a grateful heart, q said, ?Thank you, E! I now understand the wonders of electrostatic potential!? And they all lived happily ever after in Charge Land, forever measuring their electric adventures!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
":- mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan, geyser, etc. Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs. Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) (R) Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s) This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction: (i) Cu2+ + 2e? (R) Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2) (ii) Zn(s) (R) Zn2+ + 2e? (oxidation half reaction) (2.3) These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e., Ecell = Eright ? Eleft This is illustrated by the following example: Cell reaction: Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq)  3/4 (R) Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4) Half-cell reactions: Cathode (reduction): 2Ag+(aq) + 2e? (R) 2Ag(s) (2.5) Anode (oxidation): Cu(s) (R) Cu2+(aq) + 2e? (2.6) It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s) and we have Ecell = Eright ? Eleft = EAg+uAg ? ECu2+uCu.","Once upon a time in Electroville, there was a quirky little device called a galvanic cell, known for turning the magic of chemical energy into electrical energy! It was like a power plant powered by a spontaneous redox reaction.
One day, a daring zinc (Zn) and a charming copper (Cu) decided to team up for an epic adventure. ?Let?s create some electricity!? said Zn, as they formed a mighty duo. Their epic quest started with the great reaction: Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ?Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)\text{Zn(s) + Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq) } \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq) + Cu(s)}Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ?Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
?But wait!? exclaimed Cu, ?We need to break this down into our half-reactions!? So they did:
1.    Reduction at Cu: Cu2++2e??Cu(s)\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^{-} \rightarrow \text{Cu(s)}Cu2++2e??Cu(s)
2.    Oxidation at Zn: Zn(s)?Zn2++2e?\text{Zn(s)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^{-}Zn(s)?Zn2++2e?
With their roles clear, Zn donned its oxidation cape at the anode (which was super negative), while Cu put on its reduction cape at the cathode (feeling quite positive).
Now, the two half-cells needed to connect! They grabbed a metallic wire, hooked up to a voltmeter, and even used a salt bridge for good measure. ?Let?s get the electrons flowing from the negative Zn to the positive Cu!? they cheered.
As they powered up, they felt the potential difference building up between them. ?Hey, did you know this potential difference is called cell potential?? Cu said, grinning. ?And it?s measured in volts!?
Just then, a wise old electrolyte told them, ?Remember, the cell emf is given by: Ecell=Eright?Eleft\text{E}_{cell} = E_{right} - E_{left}Ecell=Eright?Eleft where the right side is the potential of the cathode and the left side is the anode!?
Excited, they represented themselves as: Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq) || Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)\text{Cu(s)|Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq) || Ag}^{+}\text{(aq)|Ag(s)}Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq) || Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)
And voila! Their adventure not only created electricity but also left a mark on Electroville, teaching everyone about the wonders of galvanic cells and the magic of redox reactions! They all lived happily ever after, buzzing with electric energy!

"A computer is an electronic device that can be programmed to accept data (input), process it and generate result (output). A computer along with additional hardware and software together is called a computer system. A computer system primarily comprises a central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices and storage devices. All these components function together as a single unit to deliver the desired output. A computer system comes in various forms and sizes. It can vary from a high-end server to personal desktop, laptop, tablet computer, or a smartphone. It is the electronic circuitry of a computer that carries out the actual processing and usually referred as the brain of the computer. It is commonly called processor also. Physically, a CPU can be placed on one or more microchips called integrated circuits (IC). The ICs comprise semiconductor materials. The CPU is given instructions and data through programs. The CPU then fetches the program and data from the memory and performs arithmetic and logic operations as per the given instructions and stores the result back to memory. While processing, the CPU stores the data as well as instructions in its local memory called registers. Registers are part of the CPU chip and they are limited in size and number. Different registers are used for storing data, instructions or intermediate results. Other than the registers, the CPU has two main components ? Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU). ALU performs all the arithmetic and logic operations that need to be done as per the instruction in a program. CU controls sequential instruction execution, interprets instructions and guides data flow through the computer?s memory, ALU and input or output devices. CPU is also popularly known as microprocessor. The devices through which control signals are sent to a computer are termed as input devices. These devices convert the input data into a digital form that is acceptable by the computer system. Some examples of input devices include keyboard, mouse, scanner, touch screen, etc., as shown in Figure 1.2. Specially designed braille keyboards are also available to help the visually impaired for entering data into a computer. Besides, we can now enter data through voice, for example, we can use Google voice search to search the web where we can input the search string through our voice. Data entered through input device is temporarily stored in the main memory (also called RAM) of the computer system. For permanent storage and future use, the data as well as instructions are stored permanently in additional storage locations called secondary memory. The device that receives data from a computer system for display, physical production, etc., is called output device. It converts digital information into humanunderstandable form. For example, monitor, projector, headphone, speaker, printer, etc. A braille display monitor is useful for a visually challenged person to understand the textual output generated by computers. A printer is the most commonly used device to get output in physical (hardcopy) form. Three types of commonly used printers are inkjet, laserjet and dot matrix. Now-a-days, there is a new type of printer called 3D-printer, which is used to build physical replica of a digital 3D design. These printers are being used in manufacturing industries to create prototypes of products. Their usage is also being explored in the medical field, particularly for developing body organs.","Once upon a time in Techland, there lived a brilliant wizard named Compute, who had the extraordinary power to accept data, process it, and produce dazzling results! Compute lived in a fantastic computer system made up of magical components.
Compute's home was powered by the mighty central processing unit (CPU), known as the brain of the operation. It was nestled comfortably on tiny integrated circuits (ICs) made from shiny semiconductor materials. ?Fetch the data!? Compute shouted, as he waved his wand and the CPU got to work.
Alongside him were two trusty sidekicks: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), who loved to do all the number crunching, and the Control Unit (CU), who expertly directed the flow of instructions. Together, they were unstoppable!
?Don?t forget about us!? chimed in the input devices: the keyboard, mouse, and even the magical touchscreen. They could transform anything into digital form, making it easy for Compute to understand. ?We even have a braille keyboard for our visually impaired friends!?
Once the data was transformed, Compute sent it off to his main memory (RAM) for a quick nap. But for long-term memories, he stored everything in secondary memory. ?I can remember everything!? Compute boasted, feeling proud.
When Compute was ready to show off his results, he summoned the output devices like the majestic monitor and powerful printer. ?Let?s print this out!? he said, and suddenly, colorful images sprang to life from the inkjet printer.
But the best part? Compute had a 3D-printer that could create real objects from his magical designs. ?Look! I?ve made a replica of my friend, the robot!? Compute exclaimed, as the robot jumped around in excitement.
And so, in the land of Techland, Compute and his magical computer system worked together, turning ideas into reality, proving that with a little programming magic, anything was possible! And they all lived happily ever after in a digital paradise!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Let us take a look at the three options that can be thought for increasing food production (i) agro-chemical based agriculture; (ii) organic agriculture; and (iii) genetically engineered crop-based agriculture. The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but yet it was not enough to feed the growing human population. Increased yields have partly been due to the use of improved crop varieties, but mainly due to the use of better management practices and use of agrochemicals (fertilisers and pesticides). However, for farmers in the developing world, agrochemicals are often too expensive, and further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding. As traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with demand and to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement, another technology called tissue culture got developed. What does tissue culture mean? It was learnt by scientists, during 1950s, that whole plants could be regenerated from explants, i.e., any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube, under sterile conditions in special nutrient media. This capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell/explant is called totipotency. You will learn how to accomplish this in higher classes. It is important to stress here that the nutrient medium must provide a carbon source such as sucrose and also inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins, cytokinins etc. By application of these methods it is possible to achieve propagation of a large number of plants in very short durations. This method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture is called micro-propagation. Each of these plants will be genetically identical to the original plant from which they were grown, i.e., they are somaclones. Many important food plants like tomato, banana, apple, etc., have been produced on commercial scale using this method. Try to visit a tissue culture laboratory with your teacher to better understand and appreciate the process. Another important application of the method is the recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants. Even if the plant is infected with a virus, the meristem (apical and axillary) is free of virus. Hence, one can remove the meristem and grow it in vitro to obtain virus-free plants. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, potato, etc. Scientists have even isolated single cells from plants and after digesting their cell walls have been able to isolate naked protoplasts (surrounded by plasma membranes). Isolated protoplasts from two different varieties of plants ? each having a desirable character ? can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts, which can be further grown to form a new plant. These hybrids are called somatic hybrids while the process is called somatic hybridisation. Imagine a situation when a protoplast of tomato is fused with that of potato, and then they are grown ? to form new hybrid plants combining tomato and potato characteristics. Well, this has been achieved ? resulting in formation of pomato; unfortunately this plant did not have all the desired combination of characteristics for its commercial utilisation. Is there any alternative path that our understanding of genetics can show so that farmers may obtain maximum yield from their fields? Is there a way to minimise the use of fertilisers and chemicals so that their harmful effects on the environment are reduced? Use of genetically modified crops is a possible solution. Plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation are called Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). GM plants have been useful in many ways. Genetic modification has: (i) made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses (cold, drought, salt, heat). (ii) reduced reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops). (iii) helped to reduce post harvest losses. (iv) increased efficiency of mineral usage by plants (this prevents early exhaustion of fertility of soil). (v) enhanced nutritional value of food, e.g., golden rice, i.e., Vitamin ?A? enriched rice. In addition to these uses, GM has been used to create tailor-made plants to supply alternative resources to industries, in the form of starches, fuels and pharmaceuticals. Some of the applications of biotechnology in agriculture that you will study in detail are the production of pest resistant plants, which could decrease the amount of pesticide used. Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt for short). Bt toxin gene has been cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide resistance to insects without the need for insecticides; in effect created a bio-pesticide. Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean etc. Bt Cotton: Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm), coleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes). B. thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These crystals contain a toxic insecticidal protein. Why does this toxin not kill the Bacillus? Actually, the Bt toxin protein exist as inactive protoxins but once an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form of toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals. The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and create pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death of the insect. Specific Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and incorporated into the several crop plants such as cotton (Figure 10.1). The choice of genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as most Bt toxins are insect-group specific. The toxin is coded by a gene cryIAc named cry. There are a number of them, for example, the proteins encoded by the genes cryIAc and cryIIAb control the cotton bollworms, that of cryIAb controls corn borer Pest Resistant Plants: Several nematodes parasitise a wide variety of plants and animals including human beings. A nematode Meloidegyne incognitia infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which was based on the process of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense. This method involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA (silencing). The source of this complementary RNA could be from an infection by viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements (transposons) that replicate via an RNA intermediate. Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant (Figure 10.2). The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host cells. These two RNA?s being complementary to each other formed a double stranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus, silenced the specific mRNA of the nematode. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA. The transgenic plant therefore got itself protected from the parasite.","Once in the land of Agraria, three wise wizards gathered to boost food production. They were known as Agro-Chemist, Organic, and Genetic Genie. The Green Revolution had tripled food supply, but alas, the growing population still needed more!
Agro-Chemist waved his wand of fertilizers and pesticides, but the poor farmers of Agraria found them too costly. Then, Organic stepped in, promising to make everything natural, but he needed more magical spells!
Suddenly, the Genetic Genie revealed a shiny potion called tissue culture. ""With this magic, we can grow whole plants from tiny pieces called explants!"" he declared. ?This is known as totipotency!?
They discovered they could produce thousands of identical plants in no time using micro-propagation. ?Tomatoes and bananas for everyone!? shouted the Genie. They even rescued sick plants by taking their meristem?the healthy part? and growing them in a lab to make virus-free plants.
One day, the Genie decided to mix things up. He fused protoplasts from a tomato and a potato to create the legendary Pomato! ?Look, a plant with the best of both worlds!? he laughed, but it didn?t turn out quite right for the farmers.
The wizards thought of new ideas. Could genetically modified organisms (GMOs) save the day? ?Absolutely!? said the Genie. He explained how GM crops were designed to resist cold, drought, and even pests. ?We can make food better without all those chemicals!?
Then, they discovered the magic of Bt toxin from a friendly bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis. ?With this, we can make pest-resistant plants like Bt cotton!? he cheered. The insects would munch on the plants and... poof! They?d be gone!
Lastly, they introduced RNA interference (RNAi) to zap pesky nematodes that ruined crops. ?Take that, root invaders!? yelled Agro-Chemist as they launched their new weapon.
And so, with a blend of agriculture magic and modern science, the wizards of Agraria worked together, creating a bountiful feast for all, proving that when it comes to farming, teamwork really does make the dream work!

"The above case is an example of a successful organisation which is amongst the top companies in India. It has risen to the top because of its quality of management. Management is required in all kinds of organisations?those manufacturing handlooms, trading in consumer goods or providing hairstyling services and even in non-business organisations. Let us take another example. Smita Rai is a 38-year old entrepreneur who grew up in a rural district called Namchi, South Sikkim. She was very good in art and craft particularly, Wax moulds. She loved to make candles, often she make into toys and small pieces of art with wax and used it as a gift for her friends and relatuves. She was loved and appreciated for these. Smita was never happy with the conditions of the women in her district as most were poor and jobless, so she planned to do something to solve their problems because she knew that imparting skills for livelihood is needed but she had no idea of how to implement her idea. In August 2012, she met Abishek Lama, the Branch Manager of NEDFI, Namchi Branch, a financial corporation which support local people with skills development programs and also channelize them into revenue generating activities. Smita got interested. ?I love making candles, then, why not convert my hobby into a venture and involve these rural women also?, she thought. This led to the establishment of Namchi Designer Candles with the help of NEDFI, some financial institutions and support from different stakeholders in various dimensions. Since then, the women have never looked back, despite challenges. The women also faced a lot of harassment but they could overcome all those troubles. Namchi Designer Candles has 100 per cent women as employees and they also produce varieties of candles. During Diwali, they produce customized candles meant for the occasion. These Diwali themed candle has been a success in Sikkim as its demand increases on a yearly basis. Namchi Designer Candles has been receiving numerous awards such as North East Women Entrepreneur of the year 2015-2016 for Sikkim and Sreemanta Shankar Mission of Guwahati on 26th April 2018 at New Delhi. A typical day in Smita?s life consists of a series of interrelated and continuous functions. She has to plan a special festive collection for Diwali. This means organising more funds and recruiting more workers. She also has to regularly communicate with her suppliers to ensure that deadlines regarding delivery of goods are met. In the course of the day, she meets customers for a general feedback and any suggestions that they may have. Smita is managing Namchi Designer Candles. So is the Principal managing your school. They all manage organisations. Schools, hospitals, shops and large corporations are all organisations with diverse goals that are aimed at achieving something. No matter what the organisation is or what its goals might be, they all have something in common-management and managers. You have observed that Smita?s work as a manager consists of a series of different activities or functions aimed at achieving the goals of the organisation. These interconnected and interdependent functions are part of management. Successful organisations do not achieve their goals by chance but by following a deliberate process called ?management?. Management is essential for all organisations big or small, profit or non-profit, services or manufacturing. Management is necessary so that individuals make their best contribution towards group objectives. Management consists of a series of interrelated functions that are performed by all managers. Later in this chapter you will understand that although both of them are managers, they function at different levels in the organisation. The time spent by managers in different functions however is different. Managers at the top level spend more time in planning and organising than managers at lower levels of the organisation.","In a quaint little village in Namchi, South Sikkim, there lived a talented woman named Smita Rai. She was known for her creative wax moulds, crafting everything from candles to charming toys. Her friends and relatives adored her creations, but Smita felt a bit sad for the women around her, who were struggling with poverty and unemployment.
One sunny day in August 2012, Smita met Abishek Lama, the magical Branch Manager of NEDFI. ?I love candles! Why not turn this hobby into a business and help my community?? she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with ideas. With a sprinkle of support from NEDFI and other helpful stakeholders, Namchi Designer Candles was born!
At first, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. The women faced numerous challenges, including a fair share of harassment. But with determination and teamwork, they pushed through! Soon, the workshop buzzed with laughter as 100% of the employees were women crafting beautiful candles, especially during Diwali when they made custom creations that lit up the market.
Smita's day was a whirlwind of activities?she planned for the festive collection, organized funds, and recruited workers like a maestro conducting a symphony. Every day, she communicated with suppliers to keep everything on track and even chatted with customers for feedback. ?What do you think of our new moon-shaped candles?? she?d ask, all while dodging the occasional flying wax!
But it wasn?t just about making candles; Smita was also a manager at heart. Just like your school principal organizes classes, Smita managed her candle-making empire, showing that management is the glue that holds all organizations together?big or small, for-profit or non-profit.
As Namchi Designer Candles won awards, including the North East Women Entrepreneur of the Year in 2015, Smita knew she had lit a fire of hope and opportunity. Her secret? The interconnected functions of management, which helped turn her dream into a delightful reality.
And so, in the land of Namchi, the Candle Chronicles continued to shine bright, proving that with a bit of management magic and teamwork, anything is possible!

"It is clear from the foregoing case that managerial pursuits at Toyota Motor Corporation are driven by principles that serve as broad guidelines for stating the vision as well as the ways to achieve it. Similarly, many other business enterprises have followed various principles in their working over a period of time. A number of management thinkers, and writers have also studied principles of management from time-to-time. In fact, there is a long history of management thought. Management principles have evolved and are in the continuous process of evolution. (see box.) You can see that the evolution of management thought has been very fascinating. In this chapter we will study the contributions of Fredrick Winslow Taylor and Henri Fayol who as you have read are associated with the classical management theory. Both of them contributed immensely towards the study of management as a discipline. Whereas F.W. Taylor was an American mechanical engineer, Henri Fayol was a French mining engineer. Taylor gave the concept of ?Scientific Management? whereas Fayol emphasised ?Administrative Principles?. But before we go into the details of their contributions let us study the meaning of the principles of management.","In the vibrant kingdom of Toyota Motor Corporation, managerial pursuits were driven by profound principles that served as guiding stars for achieving their vision. These principles weren?t just random ideas; they were the foundation upon which success was built, helping everyone in the kingdom collaborate harmoniously to produce top-notch cars.
But Toyota wasn?t alone in this grand adventure. Various enterprises across the land also adhered to their own magical principles, contributing to a rich tapestry of management thought. Over time, numerous management thinkers and writers have pondered these principles, making the evolution of management a fascinating journey.
Among these legendary figures were Fredrick Winslow Taylor and Henri Fayol. Taylor, an American mechanical engineer, introduced the concept of Scientific Management, focusing on efficiency and productivity. Picture him with a stopwatch, measuring how quickly workers could complete their tasks?his motto was all about optimizing every process to make work faster, like a finely tuned race car!
Meanwhile, across the ocean, the French mining engineer Henri Fayol emphasized Administrative Principles. He crafted a magical map for running organizations effectively, stating that managers should plan, organize, command, coordinate, and control?essentially creating a recipe for successful management.
Before diving deeper into their contributions, it?s essential to understand what the principles of management are. They serve as the golden rules that keep organizations functioning smoothly, akin to traffic lights guiding vehicles safely through intersections.
As we explore the invaluable insights from Taylor and Fayol, remember that whether you're at the helm of a massive corporation like Toyota or a small local shop, these principles are what ensure success and sustainability in the dynamic world of business. Who knows? One day, you might contribute your own wisdom to this evolving narrative!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Have you ever given a thought to the fact that the note book you use for writing has come to you after a long process of manufacturing. It started its life as part of a tree. It was cut down and transported to the pulp mill. There the wood of the tree was processed and converted into wood pulp. The wood pulp was mixed with chemicals and finally changed into paper by machines. This paper found its way to the press where ink made from chemicals was used to print the lines on the pages. The pages were then bound in the form of a note book, packed and sent to the market for sale. Finally, it reached your hands. Secondary activities or manufacturing change raw materials into products of more value to people. As you have seen pulp was changed into paper and paper into a note book. These represent the two stages of the manufacturing process. The paper made from pulp and cloth made from cotton have had value added to them at each stage of the manufacturing process. In this way the finished product has more value and utility than the raw material that it is made from. Industry refers to an economic activity that is concerned with production of goods, extraction of minerals or the provision of services. Thus we have iron and steel industry (production of goods), coal mining industry (extraction of coal) and tourism industry (service provider). Classification of Industries Industries can be classified on the basis of raw materials, size and ownership. Activity Trace the journey of your shirt from a cotton field to your wardrobe. Industries Journey begins... ...paper made... ...recycle... 4 Industries 2024-25 Raw Materials: Industries may be agro based, mineral based, marine based and forest based depending on the type of raw materials they use. Agro based industries use plant and animal based products as their raw materials. Food processing, vegetable oil, cotton textile, dairy products and leather industries are examples of agro-based industries. Mineral based industries are primary industries that use mineral ores as their raw materials. The products of these industries feed other industries. Iron made from iron ore is the product of mineral based industry. This is used as raw material for the manufacture of a number of other products, such as heavy machinery, building materials and railway coaches. Marine based industries use products from the sea and oceans as raw materials. Industries processing sea food or manufacturing fish oil are some examples. Forest based industries utilise forest produce as raw materials. The industries associated with forests are pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals, furniture and buildings. Size: It refers to the amount of capital invested, number of people employed and the volume of production. Based on size, industries can be classified into small scale and large scale industries. Cottage or household industries are a type of small scale industry where the products are manufactured by hand, by the artisans. Basket weaving, pottery and other handicrafts are examples of cottage industry. Small scale industries use lesser amount of capital and technology as compared to large scale industries that produce large volumes of products. Investment of capital is higher and the technology used is superior in large scale industries. Silk weaving and food processing industries are small scale industries (Fig 4.1). Production of automobiles and heavy machinery are large scale industries. Ownership: Industries can be classified into private sector, state owned or public sector, joint sector and cooperative sector. Private sector industries are owned and operated by individuals or a group of individuals. The public sector industries are owned and operated by the government, such as Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Activity Give some examples of agro based industries. Fig 4.1: Stages in food processing of Gorgon nut (makhana) Industries 33 2024-25 34 Resources and Development and Steel Authority of India Limited. Joint sector industries are owned and operated by the state and individuals or a group of individuals. Maruti Udyog Limited is an example of joint sector industry. Co-operative sector industries are owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials, workers or both. Anand Milk Union Limited and Sudha Dairy are a success stories of a co-operative venture","In the magical Land of Industries, a tree named Woody dreamed of becoming a famous notebook. One day, Chop the lumberjack arrived, turned Woody into wood pulp, and sent him off to the Paper Palace.
1.    At Paper Palace, Woody was mixed with chemicals, transformed into paper, and felt like royalty.
2.    Next, he was printed with ink and bound together by the Notebook Ninjas, ready to be sold at the Market of Value.
3.    Alongside, Woody met Cotton Carl, who was plucked from a field and spun into a soft shirt?another example of value addition!
4.    Woody?s journey led him to understand industries, which convert raw things into valuable products.
5.    He learned that Agro-Based Industries like food processing use plants and animals as raw materials.
6.    Mineral-Based Industries are tough, using mineral ores like iron to make heavy machines.
7.    Then there?s the Marine-Based team, which dives into the sea for seafood processing and fish oil.
8.    And finally, the Forest-Based Industries, like paper and furniture, come from forest produce (like Woody himself!).
Next, Woody learned about the size of industries.
9.    He saw Small-Scale artisans making baskets and pottery with their hands.
10.    Meanwhile, Large-Scale Industries produced automobiles and heavy machinery using advanced tech and loads of money.
Finally, Woody came across the ownership types of industries.
11.    Private Sector companies were owned by individuals, with people like Bobby the Businessman running things.
12.    Public Sector industries, like Hindustan Aeronautics, were owned by the government.
13.    Then there was the Joint Sector, where the state and individuals teamed up, like with Maruti Udyog.
14.    Woody loved the Cooperative Sector, where producers and workers owned it together, like Anand Milk Union.
And so, Woody finally arrived on a student?s desk, proud of his journey from tree to notebook?now fully understanding the magical world of industries!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Factors Affecting Location of Industries The factors affecting the location of industries are the availability of raw material, land, water, labour, power, capital, transport and market. Industries are situate d where some or all of these factors are easily available. Sometimes, the government provides incentives like subsidised power, lower transport cost and other infrastructure so that industries may be located in backward areas. Industrialisation often leads to development and growth of towns and cities. Industrial System An industrial system consists of inputs, processes and outputs. The inputs are the raw materials, labour and costs of land, transport, power and other infrastructure. The processes include a wide range of activities that convert the raw material into finished products. The outputs are the end product and the income earned from it. In case of the textile industry the inputs may be cotton, human labour, factory and transport cost. The processes include ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing and printing. The output is the shirt you wear. Industrial Regions Industrial regions emerge when a number of industries locate close to each other and share the benefits of their closeness. Major industrial regions of the world are eastern North America, western and central Europe, eastern Europe and eastern Asia (Fig 4.4). Major Fig 4.3: Locational factors for industries Activity Find out the inputs, outputs and processes involved in the manufacture of a leather shoe. Fig 4.2: Sudha dairy in Co-operative sector 2024-25 Industries 35 Fig 4.4: World?s Industrial Regions industrial regions tend to be located in the temperate areas, near sea ports and especially near coal fields. India has several industrial regions like MumbaiPune cluster, Bangalore-Tamil Nadu region, Hugli region, Ahmedabad-Baroda region, Chottanagpur industrial belt, Vishakhapatnam-Guntur belt, Gurgaon-Delhi-Meerut region and the Kollam-Thiruvanathapuram industrial cluster. Industrial Disaster In industries, accidents/disasters mainly occur due to technical failure or irresponsible handling of hazardous material. One of the worst industrial disasters of all time occurred in Bhopal on 3 December 1984 around 00:30 a.m. It was a technological accident in which highly poisonous Methyl Isocynate (MIC) gas along with Hydrogen Cyanide and other reaction products leaked out of the pesticide factory of Union Carbide. The official death toll was 3,598 in 1989. Thousands, who survived still suffer from one or many ailments like blindness, impaired immune system, gastrointestinal disorders, etc. Union Carbide Factory 2024-25 36 Resources and Development In another incident, on 23 December 2005, due to gas well blowout in Gao Qiao, Chongging, China, 243 people died, 9,000 were injured and 64,000 were evacuated. Many people died because they were unable to run after the explosion. Those who could not escape in time suffered burns to their eyes, skin and lungs from the gas. Risk Reduction Measures 1. Densely populated residential areas should be separated far away from the industrial areas. 2. People staying in the vicinity of industries should be aware of the storage of toxins or hazardous substances and their possible effects in case if an accident occurs. 3. Fire warning and fighting system should be improved. 4. Storage capacity of toxic substances should be limited. 5. Pollution dispersion qualities in the industries should be improved.","In the Land of Factories, there was a wise old factory named Fabio the Factory. Fabio had some golden rules for new factories.
1.    ""First,"" he declared, ?you need to settle where there's plenty of raw materials! I mean, a chocolate factory without cocoa beans? That?s a disaster!""
2.    Then he told them, ""Make sure there's land nearby where you can spread out your machines.""
3.    ""And don?t forget water! Factories get thirsty, too,"" he chuckled.
4.    ""If you don?t have labour to work the machines, your factory will be a ghost town,? he warned, waving his bolts and screws.
5.    Next, Fabio spoke about power. ""Without power, we?ll be nothing but a pile of metal!""
6.    ""You also need capital?yes, money!"" Fabio added, jingling a rusty coin.
7.    ""And don?t overlook transport to ship those goods to the market. Otherwise, who will buy all your products?""
One day, the Government Genie came by and whispered, ""I?ll help by providing subsidised power and low transport costs if you set up in remote areas!"" Fabio was thrilled, knowing this would attract even more factories.
8.    Fabio often told the young factories, ?An industrial system works with three things: inputs (materials), processes (like spinning and weaving), and outputs (the fancy shirt we all love).?
9.    Young factories started clustering around Fabio, creating the Factory Friends Region, sharing resources and thriving.
Then came Disaster Dan one day, showing up with Methyl Isocyanate gas, and causing mayhem in Bhopal. Fabio was horrified!
10.    To avoid future disasters, Fabio shared his Risk Reduction tips:
o    ?Stay away from densely populated areas.?
o    ?Make people nearby aware of hazards.?
o    ?Install fire alarms and limit toxic storage.?
o    And most importantly, ?Work on your pollution control skills!?
With these rules, Fabio kept the Land of Factories safe and prosperous, ensuring both growth and safety.","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Distribution of Major Industries The world?s major industries are the iron and steel industry, the textile industry and the information technology industry. The iron and steel and textile industry are the older industries while information technology is an emerging industry. The countries in which iron and steel industry is located are Germany, USA, China, Japan and Russia. Textile industry is concentrated in India, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The major hubs of Information technology industry are the Silicon valley of Central California and the Bangalore region of India. Iron and Steel Industry Like other industries iron and steel industry too comprises various inputs, processes and outputs. This is a feeder industry whose products are used as raw material for other industries. The inputs for the industry include raw materials such as iron ore, coal and limestone, along with labour, capital, site and other infrastructure. The process of converting iron ore into steel involves many stages. The raw material is put in the blast furnace where it undergoes smelting (Fig 4.6). It is then refined. The output obtained is steel which may be used by other industries as raw material. Do you know? Emerging industries are also known as ?Sunrise Industries?.These include Information technology, Wellness, Hospitality and Knowledge. Glossary Smelting It is the process in which metals are extracted from their ores by heating beyond the melting point Rescue operation in Gao Qiao 2024-25 Industries 37 Steel is tough and it can easily be shaped, cut, or made into wire. Special alloys of steel can be made by adding small amounts of other metals such as aluminium, nickel, and copper. Alloys give steel unusual hardness, toughness, or ability to resist rust. Steel is often called the backbone of modern industry. Almost everything we use is either made of iron or steel or has been made with tools and machinery of these metals. Ships, trains, trucks, and autos are made largely of steel. Even the safety pins and the needles you use are made from steel. Oil wells are drilled with steel machinery. Steel pipelines transport oil. Minerals are mined with steel equipment. Farm machines are mostly steel. Large buildings have steel framework. Before 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry was located where raw materials, power supply and running water were easily available. Later the ideal location for the industry was near coal fields and close to canals and railways. After 1950, iron and steel industry began to be located on large areas of flat land near sea ports. This is because by this time steel works had become very large and iron ore had to be imported from overseas (Fig 4.7). In India, iron and steel industry has developed taking Fig. 4.6: From iron ore to steel in a blast furnace Fig 4.5: Manufacturing of steel 8 tonnes of coal + 1 tonne of steel = 4 tonnes of iron ore 1 tonne of limestone + Fig 4.7: The changing location of the iron and steel industry 1: The best location before 1800 2: The best location from 1800 to 1950 3: The best location since 1950 2024-25 38 Resources and Development advantage of raw materials, cheap labour, transport and market. All the important steel producing centres such as Bhilai, Durgapur, Burnpur, Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bokaro are situated in a region that spreads over four states ? West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Bhadravati and Vijay Nagar in Karnataka, Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Salem in Tamil Nadu are other important steel centres utilising local resources.","Once upon a time in Industry Land, three famous industries?Iron and Steel, Textile, and Information Technology?were having a world tour competition.
1.    First stop, Germany! The Iron and Steel industry showed off its blast furnace, where it turned iron ore and coal into shiny steel.
2.    The USA joined in with its steel mills, boasting about its ships and skyscrapers built from steel.
3.    China couldn?t resist showing off its steel trains and machines, making everyone cheer!
4.    In Japan and Russia, steel was made with special alloys to give it superpowers like toughness and rust resistance.
Meanwhile, Textile Tilly made a grand entrance in her cotton dress at India, ready to showcase her fabric skills.
5.    She also visited Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan to display her beautiful fabrics and clothes.
6.    Tilly said, ""Look at my designs! They come from cotton, silk, and wool, and are woven with skill and style.""
Then came the star of the future, Information Technology Ivan, zooming in on his computer.
7.    He showed off Silicon Valley in California, where all things tech were born.
8.    Ivan finished his tour in Bangalore, India, flashing screens full of software magic and digital dreams.
Finally, they came to Iron and Steel?s factory in India. They saw Bhilai, Durgapur, Bokaro, and Jamshedpur working together, producing tough steel used in trains, buildings, and machines.
9.    Before 1800, steel factories needed water and coal, so they settled near rivers and coal mines.
10.    But after 1950, they all set up near sea ports to easily import iron ore.
The crowd cheered as Bokaro held up a steel beam saying, ?We?re the backbone of everything?from skyscrapers to safety pins!?
And so, Industry Land?s grand tour ended, with everyone knowing that iron and steel, textiles, and IT are crucial industries around the world, each with a unique role and special location.","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Jamshedpur Before 1947, there was only one iron and steel plant in the country ? Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO). It was privately owned. After Independence, the government took the initiative and set up several iron and steel plants. TISCO was started in 1907 at Sakchi, near the confluence of the rivers Subarnarekha and Kharkai in Jharkhand. Later on Sakchi was renamed as Jamshedpur. Geographically, Jamshedpur is the most conveniently situated iron and steel centre in the country. Fig 4.8: World: Major Iron Ore Producing Areas 2024-25 Industries 39 Fig 4.9: Location of iron and steel industry in Jamshedpur Sakchi was chosen to set up the steel plant for several reasons. This place was only 32 km away from Kalimati station on the Bengal-Nagpur railway line. It was close to the iron ore, coal and manganese deposits as well as to Kolkata, which provided a large market. TISCO, gets coal from Jharia coalfields, and iron ore, limestone, dolomite and manganese from Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers ensured sufficient water supply. Government initiatives provided adequate capital for its later development. In Jamshedpur, several other industrial plants were set up after TISCO. They produce chemicals, locomotive parts, agricultural equipment, machinery, tinplate, cable and wire. The development of the iron and steel industry opened the doors to rapid industrial development in India. Almost all sectors of the Indian industry depend heavily on the iron and steel industry for their basic infrastructure. The Indian iron and steel industry consists of large integrated steel plants as well as mini Let?s do With the help of an atlas identify some iron and steel industries in India and mark their location on an outline map of India. Sketch 2024-25 40 Resources and Development steel mills. It also includes secondary producers, rolling mills and ancillary industries. Pittsburgh : It is an important steel city of the United States of America. The steel industry at Pittsburgh enjoys locational advantages. Some of the raw material such as coal is available locally, while the iron ore comes from the iron mines at Minnesota, about 1500 km from Pittsburgh. Between these mines and Pittsburgh is one of the world?s best routes for shipping ore cheaply ? the famous Great Lakes waterway. Trains carry the ore from the Great Lakes to the Pittsburgh area. The Ohio, the Monogahela and Allegheny rivers provide adequate water supply. Today, very few of the large steel mills are in Pittsburgh itself. They are located in the valleys of the Monogahela and Allegheny rivers above Pittsburgh and along the Ohio River below it. Finished steel is transported to the market by both land and water routes. The Pittsburgh area has many factories other than steel mills. These use steel as their raw material to make many different products such as railroad equipment, heavy machinery and rails.","Once in Iron Land, there were two mighty steel cities: Jamshedpur in India and Pittsburgh in the USA. Both had their steel secrets and unique stories to tell.
1.    Jamshedpur, formerly known as Sakchi, was founded in 1907 by a bold adventurer named TISCO (Tata Iron and Steel Company).
2.    Sakchi got an upgrade when it was renamed Jamshedpur because of its prime location near the Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers, giving it a steady supply of water.
3.    The Bengal-Nagpur railway line was only 32 km away, making it easy to bring in iron ore, coal, and manganese.
4.    Jamshedpur got coal from Jharia, and iron ore and dolomite from Odisha and Chhattisgarh, turning it into a booming steel city!
5.    Thanks to government support, Jamshedpur grew rapidly, adding industries for locomotive parts, chemicals, machinery, and tinplate.
Across the ocean, in the USA, Pittsburgh had its own steel story.
6.    Pittsburgh, or Steel City USA, had local coal but imported iron ore from Minnesota, a whopping 1500 km away!
7.    Luckily, the Great Lakes waterway helped ship the ore cheaply.
8.    The ore traveled by train from the Great Lakes to Pittsburgh, passing scenic rivers like the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny.
9.    Soon, Pittsburgh?s steel plants spread from the main city to the nearby river valleys, making steel for trains, machinery, and rails.
One day, Jamshedpur and Pittsburgh had a friendly showdown.
10.    Jamshedpur boasted, ?I started as one factory by TISCO but became an industrial giant, producing everything from cables to agricultural tools!?
11.    Pittsburgh grinned and said, ?I?ve got the Great Lakes as my shipping secret and legendary rivers to supply my water!?
12.    Together, they realized they were both crucial to modern industry, creating the backbone of buildings, machines, and transport.
And so, the two steel cities celebrated their differences and similarities, becoming legends of Iron Land for their industrial might and unique histories!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"From the last chapter, we recall that all living organisms are made of cells. In unicellular organisms, a single cell performs all basic functions. For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries out movement, intake of food, gaseous exchange and excretion. But in multicellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialised to carry out specific functions. Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells. Since these cells carry out only a particular function, they do it very efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on. In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour. Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body. This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite place in the body. This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of function. Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues. A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a particular function forms a tissue. 6.1 Are Plants and Animals Made of Same Types of Tissues? Let us compare their structure and functions. Do plants and animals have the same structure? Do they both perform similar functions? There are noticeable differences between the two. Plants are stationary or fixed ? they don?t move. Since they have to be upright, they have a large quantity of supportive tissue. The supportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter. They consume more energy as compared to plants. Most of the tissues they contain are living. Another difference between animals and plants is in the pattern of growth. The growth in plants is limited to certain regions, while this is not so in animals. There are some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life. These tissues are localised in certain regions. Based on the dividing capacity of the tissues, various plant tissues can be classified as growing or meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell growth in animals is more uniform. So, there is no such demarcation of dividing and nondividing regions in animals. The structural organisation of organs and organ systems is far more specialised and localised in complex animals than even in very complex plants. This fundamental difference reflects the different modes of life pursued by these two major groups of organisms, particularly in their different feeding methods. Also, they are differently adapted for a sedentary existence on one hand (plants) and active locomotion on the other (animals), contributing to this difference in organ system design. It is with reference to these complex animal and plant bodies that we will now talk about the concept of tissues in some detail.","Imagine a world where Amoeba wanted to form a band with a bunch of Muscle cells and Nerve cells! Our single-celled buddy Amoeba is busy rocking alone, moving, eating, and breathing solo, until it hears of a multicellular concert. So, it decides to team up with other cells!
At the concert, Muscle cells are flexing, contracting, and relaxing to the beat, giving the crowd some smooth moves. Nerve cells are acting as the band's message carriers, zooming signals from the brain to every other cell, making sure no cell misses a note. Blood is the event planner, circulating all around, transporting oxygen, food, and even the exit passes (waste materials) for the cells ready to leave. Over in plants, the Vascular tissues (plant?s UPS) are delivering food and water from the root to the tip-top leaf.
Next, Tissues form little bands of specialized cell groups for specific tasks, like Blood, Phloem, and Muscle tissues, making everyone?s job super efficient.
In this world, plants are the chill performers; they stand still (all thanks to supportive tissues like dead cells). Meanwhile, animals are wild dancers, hopping around in search of food, mates, and shelter, so they?re powered by living cells.
Plants also have a unique style; they only grow in certain spots (like hair roots), while animals grow pretty much everywhere. Plants? Meristematic tissues keep them growing, while Permanent tissues handle the routine work. Animals, on the other hand, don?t need such areas since their cells grow more evenly.
So, remember: plants are the calm, home-based team with specific growth spots, while animals are high-energy movers with more complex systems.","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
". 6.2 Plant Tissues 6.2.1 MERISTEMATIC TISSUE ? From the above observations, answer the following questions: 1. Which of the two onions has longer roots? Why? 2. Do the roots continue growing even after we have removed their tips? 3. Why would the tips stop growing in jar 2 after we cut them? The growth of plants occurs only in certain specific regions. This is because the dividing tissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is located only at these points. Depending on the region where they are present, meristematic tissues are classified as apical, lateral and intercalary (Fig. 6.2). New cells produced by meristem are initially like those of meristem itself, but as they grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of other tissues. Fig. 6.1: Growth of roots in onion bulbs Activity ______________ 6.1 ? Take two glass jars and fill them with water. ? Now, take two onion bulbs and place one on each jar, as shown in Fig. 6.1. ? Observe the growth of roots in both the bulbs for a few days. ? Measure the length of roots on day 1, 2 and 3. ? On day 4, cut the root tips of the onion bulb in jar 2 by about 1 cm. After this, observe the growth of roots in both the jars and measure their lengths each day for five more days and record the observations in tables, like the table below: Length Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Jar 1 Jar 2 Q Apical meristem is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and the root. The girth of the stem or root increases due to lateral meristem (cambium). Intercalary meristem seen in some plants is located near the node. Fig. 6.2: Location of meristematic tissue in plant body Jar 1 Jar 2 TISSUES 69 Apical meristem Intercalary meristem 2020-21 70 SCIENCE Cuticle Epidermis Collenchyma Parenchyma Phloem Vascular bundle Xylem Fig. 6.3: Section of a stem Cells of meristematic tissue are very active, they have dense cytoplasm, thin cellulose walls and prominent nuclei. They lack vacuoles. Can we think why they would lack vacuoles? (You might want to refer to the functions of vacuoles in the chapter on cells.) 6.2.2 PERMANENT TISSUE What happens to the cells formed by meristematic tissue? They take up a specific role and lose the ability to divide. As a result, they form a permanent tissue. This process of taking up a permanent shape, size, and a function is called differentiation. Differentiation leads to the development of various types of permanent tissues. 3. Can we think of reasons why there would be so many types of cells? ? We can also try to cut sections of plant roots. We can even try cutting sections of root and stem of different plants. 6.2.2 (i) SIMPLE PERMANENT TISSUE A few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are generally simple permanent tissue. Parenchyma is the most common simple permanent tissue. It consists of relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls. They are living cells. They are usually loosely arranged, thus large spaces between cells (intercellular spaces) are found in this tissue (Fig. 6.4a). This tissue generally stores food. Activity ______________ 6.2 ? Take a plant stem and with the help of your teacher cut into very thin slices or sections. ? Now, stain the slices with safranin. Place one neatly cut section on a slide, and put a drop of glycerine. ? Cover with a cover-slip and observe under a microscope. Observe the various types of cells and their arrangement. Compare it with Fig. 6.3. ? Now, answer the following on the basis of your observation: 1. Are all cells similar in structure? 2. How many types of cells can be seen? In some situations, it contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, and then it is called chlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to help them float. Such a parenchyma type is called aerenchyma. The flexibility in plants is due to another permanent tissue, collenchyma. It allows bending of various parts of a plant like tendrils and stems of climbers without breaking. It also provides mechanical support. We can find this tissue in leaf stalks below the epidermis. The cells of this tissue are living, elongated and irregularly thickened at the corners. There is very little intercellular space ","Imagine a talking onion named Meri, who dreams of becoming the world's greatest root grower. She?s got two glass jars for her stage, named Jar 1 and Jar 2. To test her roots, Meri puts on her ?growth shoes? (roots) and watches them grow daily, measuring them every day. Meri?s roots in Jar 1 grow longer and stronger, while in Jar 2, her growth stops after she cuts off her tips. Meri?s disappointed, but she learns that only her root tips (where apical meristem lives) are magic growth points.
Then, Meri meets the Meristem Brothers: Apical (top grower of roots and stems), Lateral (girth-growing master), and Intercalary (near-node helper). They explain their special abilities and the importance of having active cells with dense cytoplasm, thin walls, and no vacuoles (no space for ?vacation,? they?re working!).
As Meri keeps learning, she meets the Permanent Tissues Club: Parenchyma, Collenchyma, and Aerenchyma. Parenchyma, the chill tissue, stores food and sometimes does photosynthesis (then it?s called chlorenchyma). Aerenchyma, the bubbly type, loves helping aquatic plants float with its big air pockets.
Collenchyma is the flexible athlete that gives plants their bendy moves. This guy?s got irregularly thickened corners but still holds plants strong without breaking. And so, Meri, with her new tissue friends, learns all about growth and support, realizing that each tissue has its own purpose?making plants the strong, diverse, and flexible organisms they are!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Yet another type of permanent tissue is sclerenchyma. It is the tissue which makes the plant hard and stiff. We have seen the husk of a coconut. It is made of sclerenchymatous tissue. The cells of this tissue are dead. They are long and narrow as the walls are thickened due to lignin. Often these walls are so thick that there is no internal space inside the cell (Fig. 6.4 c). This tissue is present in stems, around vascular bundles, in the veins of leaves and in the hard covering of seeds and nuts. It provides strength to the plant parts. Activity ______________ 6.3 ? Take a freshly plucked leaf of Rhoeo. ? Stretch and break it by applying pressure. ? While breaking it, keep it stretched gently so that some peel or skin projects out from the cut. ? Remove this peel and put it in a petri dish filled with water. ? Add a few drops of safranin. ? Wait for a couple of minutes and then transfer it onto a slide. Gently place a cover slip over it. ? Observe under microscope. What you observe is the outermost layer of cells, called epidermis. The epidermis is usually made of a single layer of cells. In some plants living in very dry habitats, the epidermis may be thicker since protection against water loss is critical. The entire surface of a plant has an outer covering epidermis. It protects all the parts of the plant. Epidermal cells on the aerial a Intercellular spaces b Wall thickenings Nucleus Vacuole Cell wall Narrow lumen Lignified thick wall c (i) c (ii) Thick lignified walls Fig. 6.5: Guard cells and epidermal cells: (a) lateral view, (b) surface view (a) (b) Guard cell Stoma Epidermal cell Guard cells parts of the plant often secrete a waxy, waterresistant layer on their outer surface. This aids in protection against loss of water, mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic fungi. Since it has a protective role to play, cells of epidermal tissue form a continuous layer without intercellular spaces. Most epidermal cells are relatively flat. Often their outer and side walls are thicker than the inner wall. We can observe small pores here and there in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores are called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are enclosed by two kidney-shaped cells called guard cells. They are necessary for exchanging gases with the atmosphere. Transpiration (loss of water in the form of water vapour) also takes place through stomata. 2020-21 72 SCIENCE Recall which gas is required for photosynthesis. Find out the role of transpiration in plants. Epidermal cells of the roots, whose function is water absorption, commonly bear long hairlike parts that greatly increase the total absorptive surface area. In some plants like desert plants, epidermis has a thick waxy coating of cutin (chemical substance with waterproof quality) on its outer surface. Can we think of a reason for this? Is the outer layer of a branch of a tree different from the outer layer of a young stem? As plants grow older, the outer protective tissue undergoes certain changes. A strip of secondary meristem located in the cortex forms layers of cells which constitute the cork. Cells of cork are dead and compactly arranged without intercellular spaces (Fig. 6.6). They also have a substance called suberin in their walls that makes them impervious to gases and water. is a distinctive feature of the complex plants, one that has made possible their survival in the terrestrial environment. In Fig. 6.3 showing a section of stem, can you see different types of cells in the vascular bundle? Xylem consists of tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma (Fig. 6.7 a,b,c) and xylem fibres. Tracheids and vessels have thick walls, and many are dead cells when mature. Tracheids and vessels are tubular structures. This allows them to transport water and minerals vertically. The parenchyma stores food. Xylem fibres are mainly supportive in function. Phloem is made up of five types of cells: sieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma [Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with perforated walls. Phloem transports food from leaves to other parts of the plant. Except phloem fibres, other phloem cells are living cells. 6.2.2 (ii) COMPLEX PERMANENT TISSUE The different types of tissues we have discussed until now are all made of one type of cells, which look like each other. Such tissues are called simple permanent tissue. Yet another type of permanent tissue is complex tissue. Complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells. All these cells coordinate to perform a common function. Xylem and phloem are examples of such complex tissues. They are both conducting tissues and constitute a vascular bundle.","Meet Scary Sclerenchyma?a super tough character known for making plants hard and stiff, like a coconut husk bodyguard. Scary Sclerenchyma?s friends are dead cells with walls so thick (thanks to lignin) that they have no space inside. They hang out in stems, veins of leaves, and nut shells, giving plants the strength of a superhero.
Next, we meet Epidermis the Protector, the outer layer of every plant. Epidermis has a waxy shield that protects the plant from water loss, injuries, and even parasitic fungi. In dry areas, Epidermis grows a thick, waxy coat (like armor) called cutin to keep water in, especially in desert plants. Guard cells (its bodyguards) form little doors called stomata that open and close to let gases in and out, helping with transpiration (water vapor loss).
Down below, the root epidermis has long, hair-like extensions for extra water absorption.
When plants age, Epidermis retires and is replaced by Cork, a new protective layer with suberin that makes it waterproof and airtight.
Finally, there?s the legendary Vascular Duo: Xylem and Phloem. Xylem is the ""Water Highway,"" made of tracheids, vessels, and xylem fibers, mostly dead cells, which carry water and minerals upward. On the other hand, Phloem is the ""Food Express,"" moving sugar from the leaves to the rest of the plant with sieve tubes, companion cells, and phloem fibers (the only dead ones here).
So, remember: Scary Sclerenchyma is tough, Epidermis is the protector, Cork takes over with age, and Xylem and Phloem are the plant?s very own delivery team!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"6.3 Animal Tissues When we breathe we can actually feel the movement of our chest. How do these body parts move? For this we have specialised cells called muscle cells (Fig. 6.8). The contraction and relaxation of these cells result in movement. Q Fig. 6.8: Location of muscle fibres Smooth muscle fibres Smooth muscle fibre (Cell) Nucleus During breathing we inhale oxygen. Where does this oxygen go? It is absorbed in the lungs and then is transported to all the body cells through blood. Why would cells need oxygen? The functions of mitochondria we studied earlier provide a clue to this question. Blood flows and carries various substances from one part of the body to the other. For example, it carries oxygen and food to all cells. It also collects wastes from all parts of the body and carries them to the liver and kidney for disposal. Blood and muscles are both examples of tissues found in our body. On the basis of the functions they perform we can think of different types of animal tissues, such as epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and nervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective tissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue. 6.3.1 EPITHELIAL TISSUE The covering or protective tissues in the animal body are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers most organs and cavities within the body. It also forms a barrier to keep different body systems separate. The skin, the lining of the mouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli and kidney tubules are all made of epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed and form a continuous sheet. They have only a small amount of cementing material between them and almost no intercellular spaces. Obviously, anything entering or leaving the body must cross at least one layer of epithelium. As a result, the permeability of the cells of various epithelia play an important role in regulating the exchange of materials between the body and the external environment and also between different parts of the body. Regardless of the type, all epithelium is usually separated from the underlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous basement membrane. Different epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing structures that correlate with their unique functions. For example, in cells lining blood vessels or lung alveoli, where transportation of substances occurs through a selectively permeable surface, there is a simple flat kind 2020-21 74 SCIENCE Fig. 6.9: Different types of epithelial tissues of skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are extremely thin and flat and form a delicate lining. The oesophagus and the lining of the mouth are also covered with squamous epithelium. The skin, which protects the body, is also made of squamous epithelium. Skin epithelial cells are arranged in many layers to prevent wear and tear. Since they are arranged in a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called stratified squamous epithelium. Where absorption and secretion occur, as in the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial cells are present. This columnar (meaning ?pillar-like?) epithelium facilitates movement across the epithelial barrier. In the respiratory tract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has cilia, which are hair-like projections on the outer surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can move, and their movement pushes the mucus forward to clear it. This type of epithelium is thus ciliated columnar epithelium. Cuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped cells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and ducts of salivary glands, where it provides mechanical support. Epithelial cells often acquire additional specialisation as gland cells, which can secrete substances at the epithelial surface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial tissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland is formed. This is glandular epithelium. 6.3.2 CONNECTIVE TISSUE Blood is a type of connective tissue. Why would it be called ?connective? tissue? A clue is provided in the introduction of this chapter! Now, let us look at this type of tissue in some more detail. The cells of connective tissue are loosely spaced and embedded in an intercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix may be jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature of matrix differs in concordance with the function of the particular connective tissue","Epi the Skin Detective is the star protector, covering every organ and lining in the body with his epithelial tissue coat. Epi?s crew includes the Squamous Squad (thin and flat like paper), which forms a delicate lining on places like the mouth and esophagus. When things get rough, he calls in Stratified Squamous?a layer of strong protectors stacked together like bricks to save skin from wear and tear.
In the digestive world, Columnar Epi (long and tall like a column) helps absorb nutrients, while Ciliated Columnar in the respiratory tract has hairy cilia that push out dust like little brooms. When Epi needs some heavy-duty support, he calls Cuboidal Cube Team for lining the kidney tubules.
Next, Blood the Traveler comes in?a type of connective tissue. Blood is loose, flowing, and perfect for transporting oxygen and food to all cells, while collecting waste to drop off at the liver. Blood?s matrix (think jelly) gives him the power to carry red and white cells for ultimate delivery duty.
So, when life needs protection (Epi), transport (Blood), or support (Cube), they?re always ready to team up and keep the body in action!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Activity 6.4 Take a drop of blood on a slide and observe different cells present in it under a microscope. of epithelium. This is called the simple squamous epithelium (squama means scale (a) Squamous (b) Stratified squamous (c) Cuboidal (d) Columnar (Ciliated) 2020-21 TISSUES 75 Blood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called plasma, in which red blood corpuscles (RBCs), white blood corpuscles (WBCs) and platelets are suspended. The plasma contains proteins, salts and hormones. Blood flows and transports gases, digested food, hormones and waste materials to different parts of the body. Bone is another example of a connective tissue. It forms the framework that supports the body. It also anchors the muscles and supports the main organs of the body. It is a strong and nonflexible tissue (what would be the advantage of these properties for bone functions?). Bone cells are embedded in a hard matrix that is composed of calcium and phosphorus compounds. Two bones can be connected to each other by another type of connective tissue called the ligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has considerable strength. Ligaments contain very little matrix and connect bones with bones. Tendons connect muscles to bones and are another type of connective tissue. Tendons are fibrous tissue with great strength but limited flexibility. Another type of connective tissue, cartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid matrix is composed of proteins and sugars. Cartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints and is also present in the nose, ear, trachea and larynx. We can fold the cartilage of the ears, but we cannot bend the bones in our arms. Think of how the two tissues are different! Areolar connective tissue is found between the skin and muscles, around blood vessels and nerves and in the bone marrow. It fills the space inside the organs, supports internal organs and helps in repair of tissues. Where are fats stored in our body? Fatstoring adipose tissue is found below the skin and between internal organs. The cells of this tissue are filled with fat globules. Storage of fats also lets it act as an insulator. 6.3.3 MUSCULAR TISSUE Muscular tissue consists of elongated cells, also called muscle fibres. This tissue is responsible for movement in our body. Fig. 6.10: Types of connective tissues: (a) types of blood cells, (b) compact bone, (c) hyaline cartilage, (d) areolar tissue, (e) adipose tissue (a) Different white blood corpuscles Neutrophil (polynuclear leucocyte) Eosinophil Basophil Nucleus Cytoplasm Lymphocyte Monocyte Platelets Haversian canal (contains blood vessels and nerve fibres) Canaliculus (contains slender process of bone cell or osteocyte) Hyaline matrix Chondrocyte Red blood corpuscle (b) (c) Reticular fibre Fibroblast Macrophage Collagen fibre Mast cell Plasma cell (d) Fat droplet Nucleus Adipocyte (e) 2020-21 76 SCIENCE [Fig. 6.11(a)]. These muscles are also called skeletal muscles as they are mostly attached to bones and help in body movement. Under the microscope, these muscles show alternate light and dark bands or striations when stained appropriately. As a result, they are also called striated muscles. The cells of this tissue are long, cylindrical, unbranched and multinucleate (having many nuclei). The movement of food in the alimentary canal or the contraction and relaxation of blood vessels are involuntary movements. We cannot really start them or stop them simply by wanting to do so! Smooth muscles [Fig. 6.11(b)] or involuntary muscles control such movements. They are also found in the iris of the eye, in ureters and in the bronchi of the lungs. The cells are long with pointed ends (spindle-shaped) and uninucleate (having a single nucleus). They are also called unstriated muscles ? why would they be called that? The muscles of the heart show rhythmic contraction and relaxation throughout life. These involuntary muscles are called cardiac muscles [Fig. 6.11(c)]. Heart muscle cells are cylindrical, branched and uninucleate. Activity 6.5 Compare the structures of different types of muscular tissues. Note down their shape, number of nuclei and position of nuclei within the cell in the Table 6.1. Table 6.1: Features Striated Smooth Cardiac Shape Number of nuclei Position of nuclei 6.3.4 NERVOUS TISSUE All cells possess the ability to respond to stimuli. However, cells of the nervous tissue are highly specialised for being stimulated and Muscles contain special proteins called contractile proteins, which contract and relax to cause movement. Fig. 6.11: Types of muscles fibres: (a) striated muscle, (b) smooth muscle, (c) cardiac muscle We can move some muscles by conscious will. Muscles present in our limbs move when we want them to, and stop when we so decide. Such muscles are called voluntary muscles (c) Striations Nuclei Spindle shaped muscle cell Nucleus (b) Nuclei Striations (a) 2020-21 TISSUES 77 (processes) called dendrites. An individual nerve cell may be up to a metre long. Many nerve fibres bound together by connective tissue make up a nerve. The signal that passes along the nerve fibre is called a nerve impulse. Nerve impulses allow us to move our muscles when we want to. The functional combination of nerve and muscle tissue is fundamental to most animals. This combination enables animals to move rapidly in response to stimuli.","Once upon a time in the Land of Tissues, there was a grand gathering for Connective Tissue Fest. Blood the Bubbly Traveler arrived first, showing off his plasma river where RBCs, WBCs, and platelets floated around like tiny party boats, carrying oxygen, nutrients, and waste to every tissue in town.
Next came Bone the Strong?hard and solid, made of calcium and phosphorus. Bone was strong and stiff, making him the ideal framework for everyone to lean on. Ligament the Bendy tagged along, happily connecting bone to bone like a bungee cord, while Tendon the Tough joined to attach muscle to bone for the ultimate flex.
Meanwhile, Cartilage the Bouncy smoothed out joints and hung out at places like the nose and ear, showing off how foldable he was, unlike the stiff bones. Nearby, Areolar the Supportive was busy filling gaps between skin and muscles, making sure everyone was snug in their places.
Over in the Muscle Zone, Striated Muscle flexed his striped look, perfect for voluntary moves like dancing, while Smooth Muscle calmly handled involuntary tasks like breathing, and Cardiac Muscle kept the heart beating with his unstoppable rhythm.
Finally, Neuron the Spark arrived, buzzing with excitement, sending nerve impulses across the crowd to make everyone move in sync. The festival ended with all tissues working together, each playing their unique role in the grand orchestra of life.","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
". In this chapter, we are going to begin with football, a game many of you have probably heard of, or even played. As the name suggests, this is a game that involves the players? feet. According to the rules of football, if the ball touches the arm of any player (except the goalkeeper), then this is considered a foul. So if players start holding the football in their hands and passing it around, then they are not playing football any more. Similarly other games, such as hockey or cricket, also have rules according to which they are played. Each of these rules helps define the game, and helps us distinguish one game from another. As these are fundamental to the game, we can also call them the constitutive rules of the game. Like these games, a society also has constitutive rules that make it what it is and differentiate it from other kinds of societies. In large societies in which different communities of people live together, these rules are formulated through consensus, and in modern countries this consensus is usually available in written form. A written document in which we find such rules is called a Constitution. We have looked at the Indian Constitution in Classes VI and VII in our Social and Political Life textbooks. Have you ever wondered why we need a Constitution or been curious about how the Constitution got written, or who wrote it? In this chapter, we will discuss both these issues and also look at the key features of the Indian Constitution. Each of these features is crucial to the working of democracy in India and some of these will be the focus of different chapters in this book. Chapter 1 The Indian Constitution 2015-16 5 The Indian Constitution Today most countries in the world have a Constitution. While all democratic countries are likely to have a Constitution, it is not necessary that all countries that have a Constitution are democratic. The Constitution serves several purposes. First, it lays out certain ideals that form the basis of the kind of country that we as citizens aspire to live in. Or, put another way, a Constitution tells us what the fundamental nature of our society is. A country is usually made up of different communities of people who share certain beliefs but may not necessarily agree on all issues. A Constitution helps serve as a set of rules and principles that all persons in a country can agree upon as the basis of the way in which they want the country to be governed. This includes not only the type of government but also an agreement on certain ideals that they all believe the country should uphold. Why Does a Country Need a Constitution? In 1934, the Indian National Congress made the demand for a Constituent Assembly. During the Second World War, this assertion for an independent Constituent Assembly formed only of Indians gained momentum and this was convened in December 1946. The photo on page 2 shows some members of the Constituent Assembly. Between December 1946 and November 1949, the Constituent Assembly drafted a constitution for independent India. Free to shape their destiny at last, after 150 years of British rule, the members of the Constituent Assembly approached this task with the great idealism that the freedom struggle had helped produce. You will read more about the work of the Constituent Assembly later in the chapter. The photo alongside shows Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressing the Constituent Assembly. ","Once upon a time in Ruleville, where games and governments were best friends, Football felt left out. ""Why do I have so many rules while my buddy, Cricket, just swings away?"" Football complained. Hockey rolled by and pointed out, ?Hey, each game has its own constitutive rules?without them, we?d just be chaos!?
Nearby, the Constitution, a wise and ancient scroll, chuckled. ?You know, societies are a lot like games,"" he said, ""except their rules are written down to bring different communities together!? Football, curious as ever, asked, ""But why do societies even need these rules?""
Constitution explained, ?Imagine a team without any game plan. That?s why India?s Constituent Assembly got together in December 1946, after years of fighting for freedom, to draft me! I?m here to guide democracy and make sure everyone knows the play.?
To prove the importance of democracy, Prime Minister Nehru dribbled a ball across the room, saying, ""We need a Constitution to keep the game fair!? Football finally got it?without rules, neither games nor countries could ever win.","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Let us try and understand what we mean by this through two contrasting situations in the recent history of Nepal, a country that borders India on the north. Until quite recently, Nepal was a monarchy. The previous Constitution of Nepal, which had been adopted in 1990, reflected the fact that the final authority rested with the King. A people?s movement in Nepal fought for several decades to establish democracy and in 2006 they finally succeeded in putting an end to the powers of the King. Now the people have to write a new Constitution to establish Nepal as a democracy. The reason that they do not want to continue with the previous Constitution is because it does not reflect the ideals of the country that they want Nepal to be, and that they have fought for. As in the game of football, in which a change in the constitutive rules will change the game altogether, Nepal, by moving from a monarchy to a democratic government, needs to change all its constitutive rules in order to usher in a new society. This is why, the people of Nepal are in the process of writing a new Constitution for the country. The caption alongside elaborates Nepal?s struggle for democracy. The second important purpose of a Constitution is to define the nature of a country?s political system. For example, Nepal?s earlier Constitution stated that the country was to be ruled by the King and his council of ministers. In countries that have adopted a democratic form of Discuss with your teacher what you understand by the term ?constitutive?. Provide one example of ?constitutive rules? from your everyday life. Why do the people of Nepal want a new Constitution? The country of Nepal has witnessed several people?s struggles for democracy. There was a people?s struggle in 1990 that established democracy that lasted for 12 years until 2002. In October 2002, King Gyanendra, citing the Maoist uprising in the countryside as his reason, began taking over different aspects of the government with the army?s assistance. The King then finally took over as the head of government in February 2005. In November 2005, the Maoists joined other political parties to sign a 12-point agreement. This agreement signalled to the larger public an imminent return to democracy and peace. In 2006, this people?s movement for democracy began gaining immense force. It repeatedly refused the small concessions that the King made and finally in April 2006 the King restored the Third Parliament and asked the political parties to form a government. In 2007, Nepal adopted an interim Constitution. The above photos show scenes from the people?s movement for democracy in 2006. 2015-16 7 In democratic societies, the Constitution often lays down rules that guard against this misuse of authority by our political leaders. In the case of the Indian Constitution, about which you will read more later in this chapter, many of these laws are contained in the section on Fundamental Rights. Do you recall the chapter on the Dalit writer, Omprakash Valmiki?s experiences in school from your Class VII book? In that chapter, we talked about the discrimination Omprakash faced because he was a Dalit. You read about how the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality to all persons and says that no citizen can be discriminated against on grounds of religion, race, caste, gender, and place of birth. The Right to Equality is one of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution","Once upon a time in a land called Nepal, there was a king named King Gyanendra who loved to play football. But his version of the game was different?he was the only one allowed to score, and if anyone else did, they had to give him a goat. Naturally, the people were tired of this ""royal football"" and wanted to play by fair rules. So, they formed a people?s team and demanded new constitutive rules (which means changing the game?s rules itself!).
In 2006, the people kicked off a giant movement for democracy, dribbling their way past the king's army and refusing all his small concessions. Finally, the king gave up and restored Parliament. The people got to work on writing a new Constitution, because they wanted rules that reflected the ideals of the country they fought for?no more unfair royal football!
Meanwhile, King Gyanendra took up yoga to deal with his newfound free time, while the people celebrated with a grand match where everyone could score (no goats involved!). The interim Constitution was written in 2007, and Nepal began its journey as a true democracy, with fair rules for all!
This story covers Nepal's struggle from monarchy to democracy, the importance of changing constitutive rules, and how a new Constitution was necessary for a fair society.","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"The Indian Constitution: Key Features By the beginning of the twentieth century, the Indian national movement had been active in the struggle for independence from British rule for several decades. During the freedom struggle the nationalists had devoted a great deal of time to imagining and planning what a free India would be like. Under the British, they had been forced to obey rules that they had had very little role in making. The long experience of authoritarian rule under the colonial state convinced Indians that free India should be a democracy in which everyone should be treated equally and be allowed to participate in government. What remained to be done then was to work out the ways in which a democratic government would be set up in India and the rules that would determine its functioning. This was done not by one person but by a group of around 300 people who became members of the Constituent Assembly in 1946 and who met periodically for the next three years to write India?s Constitution. There was an extraordinary sense of unity amongst the members of the Constituent Assembly. Each of the provisions of the future constitution was discussed in great detail and there was a sincere effort to compromise and reach an agreement through consensus. The above photo shows Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a prominent member of the Constituent Assembly. Let us recap the reasons why the Constitution plays an important role in democratic societies by recalling the constitutive rules that you have read about through these examples: Example Constitutive Rules The people of Nepal are writing a new It lays down ideals that define the kind of Constitution after the success of the country that we want to live in. people?s movement for democracy. Suresh, the class monitor wrongly picks on Anil, his classmate. The girls do not get to play basketball because the boys are a majority in class. Shabnam decides to revise her chapters instead of watching TV. Q 2015-16 11 These members of the Constituent Assembly had a huge task before them. The country was made up of several different communities who spoke different languages, belonged to different religions, and had distinct cultures. Also, when the Constitution was being written, India was going through considerable turmoil. The partition of the country into India and Pakistan was imminent, some of the Princely States remained undecided about their future, and the socio-economic condition of the vast mass of people appeared dismal. All of these issues played on the minds of the members of the Constituent Assembly as they drafted the Constitution. They rose to the occasion and gave this country a visionary document that reflects a respect for maintaining diversity while preserving national unity. The final document also reflects their concern for eradicating poverty through socio-economic reforms as well as emphasising the crucial role the people can play in choosing their representatives. Listed below are the key features of the Indian Constitution. While reading these, keep in mind the above-mentioned concerns of diversity, unity, socio-economic reform and representation that the authors of this document were grappling with. Try and understand the ways in which they tried to balance these concerns with their commitment to transforming independent India into a strong, democratic society. 1. Federalism: This refers to the existence of more than one level of government in the country. In India, we have governments at the state level and at the centre. Panchayati Raj is the third tier of government and you have read about this in your Class VI book. We looked at the functioning of the state government in your Class VII book and this year we will read more about the central government. The vast number of communities in India meant that a system of government needed to be devised that did not involve only persons sitting in the capital city of New Delhi and making Baba Saheb Dr Ambedkar is known as the Father of the Indian Constitution. Dr Ambedkar believed that his participation in the Constituent Assembly helped the Scheduled Castes get some safeguards in the draft constitution. But he also stated that although the laws might exist, Scheduled Castes still had reason to fear because the administration of these laws were in the hands of ?caste Hindu officers?. He, therefore, urged Scheduled Castes to join the government as well as the civil services. Chapter 1: The Indian Constitution 2015-16 Social and Political Life 12 decisions for everyone. Instead, it was important to have another level of government in the states so that decisions could be made for that particular area. While each state in India enjoys autonomy in exercising powers on certain issues, subjects of national concern require that all of these states follow the laws of the central government. The Constitution contains lists that detail the issues that each tier of government can make laws on. In addition, the Constitution also specifies where each tier of government can get the money from for the work that it does. Under federalism, the states are not merely agents of the federal government but draw their authority from the Constitution as well. All persons in India are governed by laws and policies made by each of these levels of government. ","Once upon a time in Ruleville, where games and governments were best friends, Football felt left out. ""Why do I have so many rules while my buddy, Cricket, just swings away?"" Football complained. Hockey rolled by and pointed out, ?Hey, each game has its own constitutive rules?without them, we?d just be chaos!?

" Parliamentary Form of Government: The different tiers of government that you just read about consist of representatives who are elected by the people. Your Class VII book began with the story of Kanta who was standing in line to vote during an election. The When the Constituent Assembly adopted the principle of universal adult franchise, Shri A.K. Ayyar, a member, remarked that this was done, ?with an abundant faith in the common man and the ultimate success of democratic rule, and in the full belief that the introduction of democratic government on the basis of adult suffrage will bring enlightenment and promote the well-being, the standard of life, the comfort, and the decent living of the common man?. Austin, G. 1966. The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation. Clarendon Press, Oxford. The photo below shows people standing in line to cast their votes. 2015-16 13 The word ?State? is often used in this chapter. This does NOT refer to state governments. Rather when we use State, we are trying to distinguish it from ?government?. ?Government? is responsible for administering and enforcing laws. The government can change with elections. The State on the other hand refers to a political institution that represents a sovereign people who occupy a definite territory. We can, thus, speak of the Indian State, the Nepali State etc. The Indian State has a democratic form of government. The government (or the executive) is one part of the State. The State refers to more than just the government and cannot be used interchangeably with it. Constitution of India guarantees universal adult suffrage for all citizens. When they were making the Constitution, the members of the Constituent Assembly felt that the freedom struggle had prepared the masses for universal adult suffrage and that this would help encourage a democratic mindset and break the clutches of traditional caste, class and gender hierarchies. This means that the people of India have a direct role in electing their representatives. Also, every citizen of the country, irrespective of his/her social background, can also contest in elections. These representatives are accountable to the people. You will read more about why representation is crucial to democratic functioning in Unit 2 of this book. 3. Separation of Powers: According to the Constitution, there are three organs of government. These are the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The legislature refers to our elected representatives. The executive is a smaller group of people who are responsible for implementing laws and running the government. The judiciary, of which you will read more in Unit 3 of this book, refers to the system of courts in this country. In order to prevent the misuse of power by any one branch of government, the Constitution says that each of these organs should exercise different powers. Through this, each organ acts as a check on the other organs of government and this ensures the balance of power between all three. Discuss the difference between State and Government with your teacher. Members of the Constituent Assembly feared that the executive might become too strong and ignore its responsibility to the legislature. The Assembly, therefore, included a number of provisions in the Constitution to limit and control the action taken by the executive branch of government as a whole. Chapter 1: The Indian Constitution 2015-16 Social and Political Life 14 4. Fundamental Rights: The section on Fundamental Rights has often been referred to as the ?conscience? of the Indian Constitution. Colonial rule had created a certain suspicion of the State in the minds of the nationalists and they wanted to ensure that a set of written rights would guard against the misuse of State power in independent India. Fundamental Rights, therefore, protect citizens against the arbitrary and absolute exercise of power by the State. The Constitution, thus, guarantees the rights of individuals against the State as well as against other individuals. Moreover, the various minority communities also expressed the need for the Constitution to include rights that would protect their groups. The Constitution, therefore, also guarantees the rights of minorities against the majority. As Dr Ambedkar has said about these Fundamental Rights, their object is two-fold. The first objective is that every citizen must be in a position to claim those rights. And secondly, these rights must be binding upon every authority that has got the power to make laws. In addition to Fundamental Rights, the Constitution also has a section called Directive Principles of State Policy. This section was designed by the members of the Constituent Assembly to ensure greater social and economic reforms, and to serve as a guide to the independent Indian State to institute laws and policies that help reduce the poverty of the masses. ","Once upon a time in Democratica, the land of talking animals, three wise wizards named Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary ruled the kingdom. They were best friends, but one day, Executive ate all the magical chocolate cake, and the others were furious! So, they decided to have Separation of Powers to keep things fair and prevent another chocolate crisis.
Meanwhile, everyone in Democratica, from the giraffes to the penguins, got to vote in the great Universal Adult Suffrage Carnival. Even Mr. Elephant ran for office, promising free peanuts for all. The Constitution Wizards made sure everyone had Fundamental Rights, so no one could be forced to eat broccoli against their will.
However, the evil King Castey, who hated democracy, tried to seize power using the Caste-Dragon. But the citizens, protected by their Directive Principles of State Policy Shields, stood united and told King Castey, ""Go back to the broccoli forest!""

"Surat in Gujarat on the west coast of India was one of the most important ports of the Indian Ocean trade. Dutch and English trading ships began using the port from the early seventeenth century. Its importance declined in the eighteenth century. This chapter tells the story of the crafts and industries of India during British rule by focusing on two industries, namely, textiles and iron and steel. Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the ?workshop of the world?. The industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company?s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. 2018-19 80 OUR PASTS ? III Fig. 2 ? Patola weave, mid-nineteenth century Patola was woven in Surat, Ahmedabad and Patan. Highly valued in Indonesia, it became part of the local weaving tradition there. ???????????????????????????????????? Let us first look at textile production. Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world?s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. Words tell us histories European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as ?muslin? ? a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called ?calico? (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. There are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods ? usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide.","Once upon a time, there was a magical port named Surat in Gujarat, where ships from all over the world would come to trade. The port was famous for its enchanted textiles, which were so fine that they could pass through the eye of a needle-dancing elephant! In the early seventeenth century, the Dutch and English ships discovered Surat and decided they needed these magical fabrics for their fancy ballroom dances.
Back then, India was the world's largest producer of cotton textiles, and everyone was obsessed with fabrics like muslin and calico. The Portuguese traders, who first came to India in search of spices, stumbled upon the fine cotton cloth in Calicut and decided to call it calico. Soon, all the European traders started naming different fabrics after the places they found them, like ?Muslin? from Mosul, because they thought it made them sound smarter.
But when the British East India Company came, they brought along their magic machines and began flooding India with machine-made textiles. The enchanted Indian fabrics started losing their magical glow because they couldn?t compete with the noisy British looms. The once-bustling port of Surat grew quiet, and the needle-dancing elephants had to find new jobs at the local circus.
And so, the British industrialists turned India from a land of magic textiles into a giant cotton marketplace. The enchanted fabrics may have faded, but their legacy still lives on in words like muslin, calico, and even the magical art of patola weaving!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. Similarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word Fig. 4 ? Jamdani weave, early twentieth century Jamdani is a fine muslin on which decorative motifs are woven on the loom, typically in grey and white. Often a mixture of cotton and gold thread was used, as in the cloth in this picture. The most important centres of jamdani weaving were Dacca in Bengal and Lucknow in the United Provinces. 2018-19 82 OUR PASTS ? III Fig. 5 ?

Bandanna patterns were mostly produced in Rajasthan and Gujarat. ?bandhna? (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. 2018-19 83 WEAVERS, IRON SMELTERS AND FACTORY OWNERS Spinning Jenny ? A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. Indian textiles in European markets By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles ? chintz ? in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. At this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. Competition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. However, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies ? the Dutch, the French and the English ? made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. Fig. 7 ?

The Dutch settlements in Cochin came up in the seventeenth century. Notice the fortification around the settlement. 2018-19 84 OUR PASTS ? III Fig. 8 ? Weaving centres: 1500-1750 If you look at the map you will notice that textile production was concentrated in four regions in the early nineteenth century. Bengal was one of the most important centres. Located along the numerous rivers in the delta, the production centres in Bengal could easily transport goods to distant places. Do not forget that in the early nineteenth century railways had not developed and roads were only just beginning to be laid on an extensive scale. Dacca in Eastern Bengal (now Bangladesh) was the foremost textile centre in the eighteenth century. It was famous for its mulmul and jamdani weaving. If you look at the southern part of India in the map you will see a second cluster of cotton weaving centres along the Coromandel coast stretching from Madras to northern Andhra Pradesh. On the western coast there were important weaving centres in Gujarat. Where were the major centres of weaving in the late eighteenth century? ","Once upon a time in Textile Town, there lived a crazy cloth named Chintz. Chintz was tired of being just a printed cotton cloth and wanted to travel the world! So, he decided to hop on a ship to England, where people went crazy over his colorful floral designs.
""Why do you call me Chintz?"" he asked a curious Englishman. ""Because it comes from chhint, the Hindi word for little flowers!"" the man replied, and they both laughed. Chintz felt so special that he invited his friends Cossaes and Bandanna to join the adventure.
Soon, Chintz and Bandanna learned they were part of a fashion frenzy! Everyone, including the Queen, wanted to wear them. But then came the Calico Act, and suddenly, Chintz couldn?t hang out in England anymore. ?What do we do now?? asked Cossaes.
""Let?s start a textile revolution!"" Bandanna suggested. They organized a fancy fabric party and invited weavers, iron smelters, and factory owners. They spun tales about the famous Spinning Jenny and how it could help make more clothes.
Eventually, Chintz realized that even though he had to leave England, he could still inspire new designs! So, they all set sail back to Textile Town, where they could create even more beautiful fabrics together, proving that even a piece of cloth can have a colorful adventure!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Who were the weavers? Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. The first stage of production was spinning ? a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. The decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out.
advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. But worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. Handloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. 2018-19 87 You must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. What happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur.","In the quirky Village of Weavers, a community of tanti weavers from Bengal decided to host a grand spinning competition. The villagers gathered, excited to show off their skills, which had been passed down through generations. As the sun rose, the women spun threads on their trusty charkhas and rolled them on taklis, creating colorful yarns that danced in the light.
Meanwhile, a mischievous British merchant named Mr. Cottonbottom arrived, carrying a machine that could weave faster than a cheetah! ?Why spin when you can use my magical machine?? he proclaimed, showcasing his flashy cloth. The villagers gasped and wondered if they were in trouble.
Determined to prove their worth, the weavers challenged Mr. Cottonbottom to a duel! The stakes? Whoever made the most fabulous cloth would become the new king of textiles. The villagers teamed up with chhipigars to add intricate designs, while the rangrez dyed the threads in wild colors.
The competition was fierce! In one corner, Mr. Cottonbottom cranked his machine, producing sheets of fabric. In the other corner, the weavers spun, laughed, and wove sarongs with intricate borders that told stories of their ancestors.
Finally, the judging began. The crowd erupted in laughter as the judges couldn?t help but appreciate the charm of the handwoven Khadi and the artistry of their work. ?Machine-made cloth is great, but it lacks our soul!? one judge declared, waving a vibrant sari.
Defeated, Mr. Cottonbottom conceded and left, swearing he?d never underestimate handloom weaving again. The weavers celebrated with a feast, dancing under the moonlight, and even created a new dance move called the ?Charkha Spin.?
From then on, the charkha became a beloved symbol of the village, reminding everyone that even in the face of competition, the magic of weaving and tradition could not be beaten! The village thrived, and as new weaving centers popped up in Sholapur and Madura, the weavers never forgot to have fun while keeping their craft alive!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
"Cotton mills come up The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. WEAVERS, IRON SMELTERS AND FACTORY OWNERS Fig. 10 ? Workers in a cotton factory, circa 1900, photograph by Raja Deen Dayal Most workers in the spinning departments were women, while workers in the weaving departments were mostly men. 2018-19 88 OUR PASTS ? III Smelting ? The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new Fig. 11 ? Tipu?s sword made in the late eighteenth century Written with gold on the steel handle of Tipu?s sword were quotations from the Koran with messages about victories in war. Notice the tiger head towards the bottom of the handle. By 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. In the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. ???????????????????????????? ??????????? We begin the story of Indian steel and iron metallurgy by recounting the famous story of Tipu Sultan who ruled Mysore till 1799, fought four wars with the British and died fighting with his sword in his hand. Tipu?s legendary swords are now part of valuable collections in museums in England. But do you know why the sword was so special? The sword had an incredibly hard and sharp edge that could easily rip through the opponent?s armour. This quality of the sword came from a special type of high carbon steel called Wootz which was produced all over south India. Wootz steel when made into swords produced a very sharp edge with a flowing water pattern. This pattern came from very small carbon crystals embedded in the iron. Francis Buchanan who toured through Mysore in 1800, a year after Tipu Sultan?s death, has left us an account of the technique by which Wootz steel was produced in many hundreds of smelting furnaces in Mysore. In these furnaces, iron was mixed with charcoal and put inside small clay pots. Through an intricate control of temperatures the smelters produced steel ingots that were used for sword making not just in India but in West and Central Asia too. Wootz is an anglicised 2018-19 89 version of the Kannada word ukku, Telugu hukku and Tamil and Malayalam urukku ? meaning steel. Indian Wootz steel fascinated European scientists. Michael Faraday, the legendary scientist and discoverer of electricity and electromagnetism, spent four years studying the properties of Indian Wootz (1818-22). However, the Wootz steel making process, which was so widely known in south India, was completely lost by the mid-nineteenth century. Can you guess why this was so? The swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India. Abandoned furnaces in villages Production of Wootz steel required a highly specialised technique of refining iron. But iron smelting in India was extremely common till the end of the nineteenth century. In Bihar and Central India, in particular, every district had smelters that used local deposits of ore to produce iron which was widely used for the manufacture of implements and tools of daily use. The furnaces were most often built of clay and sun-dried bricks. The smelting was done by men while women worked the bellows, pumping air that kept the charcoal burning. WEAVERS, IRON SMELTERS AND FACTORY OWNERS Fig. 12 ? Iron smelters of Palamau, Bihar Bellows ? A device or equipment that can pump ? 2018-19 90 OUR PASTS ? III By the late nineteenth century, however, the craft of iron smelting was in decline. In most villages, furnaces fell into disuse and the amount of iron produced came down. Why was this so? One reason was the new forest laws that you have read about (Chapter 4). When the colonial government prevented people from entering the reserved forests, how could the iron smelters find wood for charcoal? Where could they get iron ore? Defying forest laws, they often entered the forests secretly and collected wood, but they could not sustain their occupation on this basis for long. Many gave up their craft and looked for other means of livelihood. In some areas the government did grant access to the forest. But the iron smelters had to pay a very high tax to the forest department for every furnace they used. This reduced their income. Moreover, by the late nineteenth century iron and steel was being imported from Britain. Ironsmiths in India began using the imported iron to manufacture utensils and implements. This inevitably lowered the demand for iron produced by local smelters. By the early twentieth century, the artisans producing iron and steel faced a new competition","Once upon a time in the bustling City of Bombay, a giant cotton mill named ?Cottonopolis? opened its doors. The mill was famous for its spinning and attracted many women workers who twirled like ballerinas while making threads. Meanwhile, the men in the weaving department fancied themselves as the ?Fabric Avengers,? determined to create the strongest cloth in the land!
One day, a cheeky parrot named Polly decided to enter the mill. ?Why spin when you can swing?? she squawked, launching into a wild dance that sent threads flying everywhere! The workers laughed so hard that they forgot their tasks, and soon, colorful fabric flew like confetti all around the mill.
While this chaos unfolded, a British merchant, Mr. Cottonbottom, visited to check on his investments. He was horrified to see threads everywhere and shouted, ?This isn?t a party; it?s a factory!? But the workers were having too much fun to care.
Suddenly, a weaver named Raju had a brilliant idea! ?Let?s make the world?s first disco fabric!? He suggested. With Polly leading the dance, they spun and wove a cloth that sparkled like disco balls. Mr. Cottonbottom was baffled but intrigued, thinking it might sell well in England.
Meanwhile, in Mysore, Tipu Sultan?s legendary Wootz steel swords were being discussed at a grand banquet. ?These swords are sharper than my mother-in-law?s tongue!? joked one guest. They had their own issues, as iron smelters were struggling to find wood for charcoal due to new forest laws. ?Looks like we?re all in trouble!? one smelter sighed, scratching his head.
Back in Bombay, the workers turned the mill into a dance floor every Friday night, attracting the attention of the whole city. ?Why compete with cheap imports when we can just dance our problems away?? they laughed. Thus, the mill became a dance hub and disco fabric took the world by storm!
And so, the City of Bombay became not just a place for cotton mills but a haven for fun, laughter, and some pretty wild dance parties, proving that sometimes, the best solutions come from a little bit of chaos and a lot of laughter!","make a linking method of memory , make a illogical story , highlight main word with bold line, complete funny story in 15 line,make it easy to remember and all main point has to get covered."
